    "text": "3.1 Exploratory analysis\nAs illustrated in Figure 1.5, exploratory analysis is the first step that should be carried out in a statistical analysis. This stage is essential to inform how covariates should be introduced in the model and, in our case, whether the variation unexplained by those covariates exhibits spatial correlation.\nIn the exploratory analysis of count data, we will also look at how overdispersion, which is a necessary, though not sufficient, condition for residual spatial correlation.\n\n3.1.1 Exploring associations with risk factors using count data\nAssessment of the association between the health outcome of interest and non-categorical (i.e. continuous) risk factors can be carried using graphical tools, such scatter plots. The graphical inspection of the empirical association between the outcome and the covariates is especially useful to identify non-linear patterns in the relationship which should then be accounted for in the model formulation.\nIn this section, we look more closely at the case when the observed outcome is a count which requires a different treatment from continuously measured outcomes, which are generally covered by most statistics textbooks (see, for example, Chapter 1 of Weisberg (2014)).\n\n3.1.1.1 When the outcome is an aggregated count\nLet us first consider the example of the river-blindness data in Liberia (Section 1.4.2), and examine the association between prevalence and elevation. We first generate a plot of the prevalence against the measured elevation at each of the sample locations\n\nliberia$prev &lt;- liberia$npos/liberia$ntest\n\nggplot(liberia, aes(x = elevation, y = prev)) + geom_point() +\n  labs(x=\"Elevation (meters)\",y=\"Prevalence\")\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Scatter plot of the empirical prevalence for river-blindess against elevation, measured in meters.\n\n\n\n\nThe plot shown in Figure 3.1 shows that, as elevation increases from 0 to around 150 meters, prevalence rapidly increases to around 0.25 and, for larger values in elevation than 150 meters, the relationship levels off. This begs the question of how we can account for this in a regression model. To answer this question rigorously, however, the plot in Figure 3.1 cannot be used. This is because, when the modelled outcome is a bounded Binomial count, regression relationships are specified on the logit-transformed prevalence (log-odds) scale; see Table 1.2 in Section Section 1.5 . To explore regression relationships in the case of prevalence data, it is convenient to use the so-called empirical logit in place of the empirical prevalence. The empirical logit is defined as\n\\[\nl_{i} = \\log\\left\\{\\frac{y_i + 1/2}{n_i - y_i + 1/2}\\right\\}\n\\tag{3.1}\\]\nwhere \\(y_i\\) are the number of individuals who tested positive for riverblindness and \\(n_i\\) is the total number of people tested at a location. The reason for using the empirical logit, rather than the standard logit transformation applied directly to the empirical prevalence, is that it allows to generate finite values for empirical prevalence values of 0 and 1, for which the standard logit transformation is not defined.\n\n# The empirical logit\nliberia$elogit &lt;- log((liberia$npos+0.5)/\n                      (liberia$ntest-liberia$npos+0.5))\n\nggplot(liberia, aes(x = elevation, y = elogit)) + geom_point() +\n  \n  # Adding a smoothing spline\n  labs(x=\"Elevation (meters)\",y=\"Empirical logit\") +\n  stat_smooth(method = \"gam\", formula = y ~ s(x),se=FALSE)+\n  \n  # Adding linear regression fit with log-transformed elevation\n  stat_smooth(method = \"lm\", formula = y ~ log(x),\n              col=\"green\",lty=\"dashed\",se=FALSE) +\n\n  # Adding linear regression fit with change point in 150 meters\n  stat_smooth(method = \"lm\", formula = y ~ x + pmax(x-150, 0),\n              col=\"red\",lty=\"dashed\",se=FALSE) \n  \n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Scatter plot of the empirical prevalence for river-blindess against elevation, measured in meters.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2 shows the scatter plot of the empirical logit against elevation. In this plot, we have also added three lines though the stat_smooth from the ggplot2 package. Using this function, we first pass the term gam to method to add a penalized smoothing spline (Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman 2001), represented by the blue solid line. The smoothing spline allows us to better discern how the type of relationship and how to best capture it using a standard regression approach. As er can see from Figure 3.2, the smoothing spline corroborates our initial observation of a positive relationship up to about 150 meters, followed by a plateau.\nTo capture this non-linear relationship, we can use the two following approaches. The first is based on a simple log-transformation of elevation and is represented in Figure 3.2 by the green line. If were to express this relationship using a standard Binomial regression model, this would take the form \\[\n\\log\\left\\{\\frac{p(x_i)}{1-p(x_i)}\\right\\} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\log\\{e(x_i)\\}\n\\tag{3.2}\\] where \\(p(x_i)\\) and \\(e(x_i)\\) are the river-blindness prevalence and elevation at sampled location \\(x_i\\), respectively.\nAlternatively, the non-linear effect of elevation on prevalence could be captured using a linear spline. Put in simple terms, we want to fit a linear regression model that allows for a change in slope above 150 meters. Formally, this is expressed in a Binomial regression model as \\[\n\\log\\left\\{\\frac{p(x_i)}{1-p(x_i)}\\right\\} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 e(x_i) + \\beta_{2} \\max\\{e(x_i)-150, 0\\}.\n\\tag{3.3}\\] Based on the equation above, the effect of elevation below 150 meters is quantified by the parameter \\(\\beta_1\\). Above 150 meters, instead, the effect of elevation becomes \\(\\beta_1 + \\beta_2\\). Note that the function pmax (and not the standard base function max) should be used in R when the computation of the maximum between a scalar value and each of the components of a numeric vector is required.\nBefore proceeding further, it is important to explain the differences between the use of the logarithmic transformation (Equation 3.2) and the linear spline (Equation 3.3). We observe that both curves provide a similar fit to the data, with larger differences observed for larger values in elevation, where the log-transformed elevation models yields larger values for the predicted prevalence. This also suggests that if we were to extrapolate the predictions beyond 600 meters in elevation the implied pattern by the model with the log-transformed elevation would predict an increasingly larger elevation, which is unrealistic, since the fly that transmits the diseases cannot breed at those altitudes. The linear spline model instead would generate predictions that would be very similar to those observed between 150 and 600 meters. From this point view, the linear spline model would thus have more scientific validity than the other model. However, which of the two approaches should be chosen to model the effect of elevation is a question that closely depends on the research question to be addressed.\nIf the interest of the study was in better understanding the association between elevation and prevalence, the linear spline model does not only provide a more credible explanation but also its regression parameters can be more easily interpreted. In fact, for a unit increase in elevation, the multiplicative change in the odds for river-blindness is \\(\\exp\\{\\beta_1\\}\\), if elevation is below 150 meters, and \\(\\exp\\{\\beta_1+\\beta_2\\}\\), if elevation is above 150 meters. When instead we use the log-transformed elevation, the interpretation of \\(\\beta_1\\) in Equation 3.2 is slightly more complicated, as it is based on the multiplicative increase in elevation by the same amount given by the base of the algorithm, which is about \\(e \\approx 2.718\\)1. To avoid this, one could rescale the regression coefficient as, for example, \\(\\beta_1/\\log_{2}(e)\\) which would be interpreted as the multiplicative change in the odds for river-blindness for a doubling in elevation. However, a doubling in elevation is less meaningful when considering larger values of elevation.\nWhen the goal of statistical analysis is instead in developing a predictive model for the outcome of interest, the explanatory power and interpretability of the model may be of less concern. For this reason, the model with the log-transformed model could be preferred over the model with the linear spline, if it shown to yield more predictive power. We will come back to this point again in Chapter 5, where will show how to assess and compare the predictive performance of different geostatistical models.\nThe other type of aggregated count data that we consider are unbounded counts. The Anopheles mosquitoes data-set (Section 1.4.4) is an example of this, since there is no upper limit to the number of mosquitoes that can be trapped at a location. Let us consider the covariate represented by elevation. In this case, the simplest model that can be used to analyse the data is a Poisson regression, where the linear predictor is defined on the log of the mean number of mosquitoes (Table 1.2). Hence, exploratory plots for the association with covariates should be generated using the log transformed counts of mosquitoes. In this instance, to avoid taking the log of zero, we can add 1 to the reported counts, if required. The variable of the An.gambiae in the anopheles data-set does not contain any 0, hence we simply apply the log tranformation without adding 1.\n\nanopheles$log_counts &lt;- log(anopheles$An.gambiae)\nggplot(anopheles, aes(x = elevation, y = log_counts)) + geom_point() +\n  \n  # Adding a smoothing spline\n  labs(x=\"Elevation (meters)\",y=\"Log number of An. gambiae mosquitoes\") +\n  stat_smooth(method = \"lm\", formula = y ~ x, se=FALSE)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Scatter plot of the log tranformed number of Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes against elevation, measured in meters. The blue line is generated using the least squares fit.\n\n\n\n\nThe scatter plot of Figure 3.3 shows that there is a negative, though weak, association, with the average number of mosquitoes decreasing for increasing elevation. In this instance, the assumption of a linear relationship with elevation would be a reasonable choice.\n\n\n3.1.1.2 When the outcome is an invidual-level binary indicator\nWe now consider the malaria data from Kenya (Section 1.4.3) where the main outcome is the result from a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for malaria from individuals within households. In this case, because the outcome only takes two values, 1 for a positive RDT test result and 0 otherwise, the direct application of the empirical logit from Equation 3.1 would not help us to generate informative scatter plots. Throughout the book, we will consider the data from the community survey only, hence we work with a subset of the data which we shall name malkenya_comm\n\nmalkenya_comm &lt;- malkenya[malkenya$Survey==\"community\", ]\n\nTo show how this issue can be overcome, let us consider the variables age and gender. To generate a plot that can help us understand between the relationship with malaria prevalence and the two risk factors, we proceed as follows.\n\n# Grouping of ages into classes defined through \"breaks\"\nmalkenya_comm$Age_class &lt;- cut(malkenya_comm$Age, \n                            breaks = c(0, 5, 10, 15, 30, 40, 50, 100),\n                            include.lowest = TRUE)\n\nUsing the cut function, we first split age (in years) into classes through the argument breaks. The classification of age into \\([0,5]\\), \\((5, 10]\\) and \\((10, 15]\\) is common in many malaria epidemiology studies, as children are one of the groups at highest risk malaria. The choice of the other classes of age reflects instead the need to balance the number of observations falling in each of the classes.\n\n# Computation of the empirical logit by age groups and gender\nage_class_data &lt;- aggregate(RDT ~ Age_class + Gender, \n                                    data = malkenya_comm, \n                                    FUN = function(y) \n                                    log((sum(y)+0.5)/(length(y)-sum(y)+0.5)))\n\nWe then compute the empirical logit, using the total number of cases within age group and by gender. For a given age group and gender, which we denote as \\(\\mathcal{C}\\), the empirical logit in Equation 3.1, now takes the form \\[\nl_{\\mathcal{C}} = \\log\\left\\{\\frac{\\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{C}} y_{i} + 0.5}{|\\mathcal{C}|- \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{C}} y_{i} + 0.5} \\right\\}\n\\tag{3.4}\\] where \\(y_i\\) are the individual binary outcomes and \\(i\\in \\mathcal{C}\\) is used to indicate that the sum is carried out over all the individuals who belong the class \\(\\mathcal{C}\\), identified by a specific age group and gender. Finally, \\(|\\mathcal{C}|\\) is the number of individuals who fall within \\(\\mathcal{C}\\). In the code above, the empirical logit in Equation 3.4 is computed using the aggregate function. An inspection of the object age_class_data, a data frame, shows that the empirical is found in the column named RDT.\n\n# Computation of the average age within each age group \nage_class_data$age_mean_point &lt;- aggregate(Age ~ Age_class + Gender, \n                                 data = malkenya_comm, \n                                 FUN = mean)$Age\n\n\n# Number of individuals within each age group, by gender\nage_class_data$n_obs &lt;-  aggregate(Age ~ Age_class + Gender, \n                         data = malkenya_comm, \n                         FUN = length)$Age\n\nIn order to generate the scatter-plot, we compute the average age within each age group by gender, and use these as our values for the x-axis. Note that since we only need to obtain the average age from this output, we use $Age to extract this only and allocate to the column age_mean_point. Finally, we also compute the number of observations within each of classes and place this in n_obs.\n\nggplot(age_class_data, aes(x = age_mean_point, y = RDT, \n                           size = n_obs, \n                           colour = Gender)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  labs(x=\"Age (years)\",y=\"Empirical logit\")  \n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Plot of the empirical logit against age, for males and females. The size of each solid point is rendered proportional to the number of individuals within age group, as indicated in the legend.\n\n\n\n\nThe resulting plot in Figure 3.4 shows the empirical logit against age by gender, with the size of each of the points proportional to the number of observations falling within each class. The observed patterns are explained by the fact that young children, especially those under the age of five, are particularly vulnerable to severe malaria infections. This is primarily due to their immature immune systems and lack of acquired immunity. As individuals grow older, they generally develop partial immunity to malaria through repeated exposure to the disease. This acquired immunity can provide some level of protection against severe malaria. At the same time, gender roles and activities can influence exposure to malaria-carrying mosquitoes. For example, men may spend more time outdoors for work or other activities, increasing their exposure to mosquito bites and thus their risk of infection. In addition, there are also biological factors to consider. Hormonal and genetic differences between males and females may also contribute to variations in immune responses to malaria infection. The interaction between age and gender is complex and may vary depending on the specific context and population being studied. A 2020 report from the Bill & Melinda Gates foundation provides a detailed overview of this and other aspects related to gender and malaria (Katz and Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation 2020).\nTo account for age in a model for malaria prevalence, several approaches are possible, some of which have been developed using biological models (Smith et al. 2007). To model the patterns observed in Figure 3.4, we can follow the same approach used in the previous section to model the relationship between elevation and river-blindness prevalence. First, let us consider age without the effect of gender. Let \\(p_{j}(x_i)\\) denote the probability of a positive RDT for the \\(j\\)-th individual living in a household at location \\(x_i\\). Assuming that malaria risk reaches its peak at 15 years of age, we can capture the non-linear relationship using a linear spline with two knots, one at 15 years and a second one at 40 years. This is expressed as \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\log\\left\\{\\frac{p_{j}(x_i)}{1-p_j(x_i)}\\right\\} = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}a_{ij}+\\beta_{2} \\times\\max\\{a_{ij}-15, 0\\} + \\beta_{3}\\max\\{a_{ij}-40, 0\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{3.5}\\] where \\(a_{ij}\\) is the age, in years, for the \\(j\\)-th individual at household \\(i\\). Based on this model the effect of age on RDT prevalence is \\(\\beta_{1}\\), for \\(a_{ij} &lt; 15\\), \\(\\beta_{1}+\\beta_{2}\\), for \\(15 &lt; a_{ij} &lt; 40\\), and \\(\\beta_{1}+\\beta_{2}+\\beta_{3}\\) for \\(a_{ij} &gt; 40\\).\nFigure 3.4 indicates that age may interact with gender, meaning that the effect of gender on RDT prevalence changes across age, with larger differences observed between males and females for ages above 20 years. To assess such differences using a standard Binomial regression model, the linear predictor for RDT prevalence can be formulated as \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\log\\left\\{\\frac{p_{j}(x_i)}{1-p_j(x_i)}\\right\\} = \\beta_{0} + (\\beta_{1} + \\beta_{1}^*g_{ij})\\times a_{ij}+(\\beta_{2} + \\beta_{2}^*g_{ij})\\times\\max\\{a_{ij}-15, 0\\} + \\\\\n(\\beta_{3} + \\beta_{3}^*g_{ij}) \\times \\max\\{a_{ij}-40, 0\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{3.6}\\] where \\(g_{ij}\\) is the indicator for gender, with 1 corresponding to male and 0 to female. The coefficients \\(\\beta_{1}^*\\), \\(\\beta_{2}^*\\) and \\(\\beta_{3}^*\\) thus quantify the differences in risk between the two genders for ages below 15 years, betwee 15 and 40 years, and above 40 years, respectively. If all of those coefficients were 0, the model in Equation 3.5 would be recovered.\n\nglm_age_gender_interaction &lt;- glm(RDT ~ Age + Gender:Age + \n                                  pmax(Age-15, 0) + Gender:pmax(Age-15, 0) + \n                                  pmax(Age-40, 0) + Gender:pmax(Age-40, 0),\n                              data = malkenya_comm, family = binomial)\n\nsummary(glm_age_gender_interaction)\n## \n## Call:\n## glm(formula = RDT ~ Age + Gender:Age + pmax(Age - 15, 0) + Gender:pmax(Age - \n##     15, 0) + pmax(Age - 40, 0) + Gender:pmax(Age - 40, 0), family = binomial, \n##     data = malkenya_comm)\n## \n## Deviance Residuals: \n##     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max  \n## -0.7681  -0.7051  -0.4940  -0.2734   2.7294  \n## \n## Coefficients:\n##                              Estimate Std.

The terms Age, pmax(Age-15, 0) and pmax(Age-40, 0) respectively correspond to \\(\\beta_{1}\\), \\(\\beta_{2}\\) and \\(\\beta_{3}\\), whilst the Gender:Age, Gender:pmax(Age-15, 0) and Gender:pmax(Age-40, 0) to \\(\\beta_{1}^*\\), \\(\\beta_{2}^*\\) and \\(\\beta_{3}^*\\), respectively. In the summary of the fitted model, we observe that the interaction coefficients are non-statistically significant. However, removing the interaction based on the fact that each of the coefficients have each p-values larger than the conventional level of 5% would be wrong. Instead we should carry out the likelihood ratio test, as shown below.\n\nglm_age_gender_no_interaction &lt;- glm(RDT ~ Age +  pmax(Age-15, 0) + pmax(Age-40, 0),\n                              data = malkenya_comm, family = binomial)\n\nanova(glm_age_gender_no_interaction, glm_age_gender_interaction, test = \"Chisq\")\n## Analysis of Deviance Table\n## \n## Model 1: RDT ~ Age + pmax(Age - 15, 0) + pmax(Age - 40, 0)\n## Model 2: RDT ~ Age + Gender:Age + pmax(Age - 15, 0) + Gender:pmax(Age - \n##     15, 0) + pmax(Age - 40, 0) + Gender:pmax(Age - 40, 0)\n##   Resid.

The likelihood ratio test can then be carried out using the anova command as shown. The p-value indicates that the we do not find evidence against the null hypothesis, hence in our analysis of the data we might favour the simplified model that does not assumes an interaction between the two genders.\nThe approach just illustrated, can also be applied to explore the association with other continuous variables that are a property of the household and not of the individual. Let us, for example, consider the variable elevation from the malkenya data-set.\n\nmalekenya_comm &lt;- malkenya[malkenya$Survey==\"community\", ]\n\nmalkenya_comm$elevation_class &lt;- cut(malkenya_comm$elevation,\n                            breaks = quantile(malkenya_comm$elevation, seq(0, 1, by = 0.1)),\n                            include.lowest = TRUE)\n\nFollowing the same approach used for age, we first split elevation into classes. To define these, we use the deciles of the empirical distribution of elevation which we calculate using the quantile function above. In this way we also ensure that the number of observations falling within each class of elevation is approximately the same.\n\n# Computation of the empirical logit by classes of elevation\nelev_class_data &lt;- aggregate(RDT ~ elevation_class, \n                                    data = malkenya_comm, \n                                    FUN = function(y) \n                                    log((sum(y)+0.5)/(length(y)-sum(y)+0.5)))\n\n\n# Computation of the average elevation within each class of elevation\nelev_class_data$elevation_mean &lt;- aggregate(elevation ~ elevation_class, \n                                    data = malkenya_comm, \n                                    FUN = mean)$elevation\n\nWe then compute the empirical logit and the average elevation for each class of elevation. The empirical logit is computed as already defined in Equation 3.4, where now the definition of \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) is given by a specific decile used to split the distribution of elevation.\n\nggplot(elev_class_data, aes(x = elevation_mean, y = RDT), \n                           size = n_obs) + \n  geom_point() + \n  labs(x=\"Elevation (meters)\",y=\"Empirical logit\")  \n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: Plot of the empirical logit against elevation measured in meters.\n\n\n\n\nThe resulting plot in Figure 3.5 shows an approximately linear relationship with decreasing values of the empirical logit for increasing elevation. This is expected because the cooler environment at higher altitudes is less favourable to the development of the overall mosquito life cycle.\nAn alternative approach to generate a scatter plot for assessing the association between elevation and the empirical logit would be to aggregate the data at household level, rather than using classes of elevation. However, this approach does not work as the one illustrated above when only one individual is sampled for each location. In the case of the malkenya data, the great majority of the locations only include one individual making this second approach less useful than the one illustrated.\nOther more sophisticated approaches for the exploration of the associations between covariates and binary outcomes are available. For example, the use of the empirical logit could be avoided by using non-parametric regression methods for Binomial outcomes (Bowman 1997), also implemented in sm package in R. Our view is that a careful exploratory analysis based on simpler methods, as those illustrated above, can be equally effective to inform the module formulation.\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Exploring overdispersion in count data\nOne of the main advantages in the use of covariates is the ability to attribute part of the variation of the outcome to a set of measured variables and, hence, reduce the uncertainty of our inferences. However, it almost always the case that the finite number of covariates at our disposal is not enough to fully explain the variation in the outcome. In other words, the existence of unmeasured covariates that are related to the modelled outcome give rise to the so called residual variation. In a standard linear regression model the extent to which we are able to account for important covariates is directly linked to the size of the variance of the residuals. In the case of count data, instead, this link is less well defined and one of the main consequences of the omission of covariates, which we address in this chapter, is overdispersion.\nOverdispersion occurs when the variability of the data is larger than that implied by the generalized linear model (GLM) fitted to them. For example, if we consider the Binomial distribution, the presence of overdispersion implies that \\(V(Y_i) &gt; n_i \\mu_{i}(1-\\mu_i)\\), where we recall that \\(n_i\\) is the Binomial denominator and \\(mu_i\\) is the probability of “success” for each of the \\(n_i\\) Bernoulli trials; for a Poisson distribution with \\(E(Y_i) = \\mu_i\\), instead, overdispersion implies that \\(V(Y_i) &gt; \\mu_{i}\\).\nAssessment of the overdispersion for count data can be carried out in different ways depending on the goal of the statistical analysis. Since the focus of this book is to illustrate how to formulate and apply geostatistical models, the most natural approach to assess overdispersion is through the use of generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs). The class of GLMMs that we consider in this and the next section are obtained by replacing the spatial Gaussian process \\(S(x_i)\\) in introduced in Equation 1.4 with a set of mutually independent random effects, which we denote as \\(Z_i\\), and thus write \\[\ng(\\mu_i) = d(x_i)^\\top \\beta + Z_i.\n\\tag{3.7}\\] The model above accounts for the overdispersion in the data through \\(Z_i\\) whose variance can be interpreted as an indicator of the amount of overdispersion. To show this, we carry out a small simulation as follows. For simplicity, we consider the Binomial mixed model with an intercept only, hence \\[\n\\log\\left\\{\\frac{\\mu_i}{1-\\mu_i}\\right\\} = \\beta_0 + Z_i\n\\tag{3.8}\\] and assume that the \\(Z_i\\) follow a set of mutually independent Gaussian variables with mean 0 and variance \\(\\tau^2\\). In our simulation we vary \\(\\beta_0\\) over the set \\(\\{-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3\\}\\) and set \\(\\tau^2=0.1\\) and the binomial denominators to \\(n_i = 100\\). For a given value of \\(\\beta_0\\), we then proceed through the following iterative steps.\n\nSimulate 10,000 values for \\(Z_i\\) from a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and variance \\(\\tau^2\\).\nCompute the probabilities \\(\\mu_i\\) based on Equation 3.8.\nSimulate 10,000 values from a Binomial model with probability of success \\(\\mu_i\\) and denominator \\(n_i\\).\nCompute the empirical variance of the counts \\(y_i\\) simulated in the previous step.\nChange the value of \\(\\beta_0\\) and repeat the previous steps, for all the values of \\(\\beta_0\\).\n\nThe code below shows the implementation of the above steps in R.\n\n# Number of simulations\nn_sim &lt;- 10000\n\n# Variance of the Z_i\ntau2 &lt;- 0.1\n\n# Binomial denominator \nbin_denom &lt;- 100\n\n# Intercept values\nbeta0 &lt;- c(-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3)\n\n# Vector where we store the computed variance from\n# the simulated counts from the Binomial mixed model\nvar_data &lt;- rep(NA, length(beta0))\n\n\nfor(j in 1:length(beta0)) {\n  # Simulation of the random effects Z_i\n  Z_i_sim &lt;- rnorm(n_sim, sd = sqrt(tau2))\n\n  # Linear predictor of the Binomial mixed model\n  lp &lt;- beta0[j]  + Z_i_sim\n  \n  # Probabilities of the Binomial distribution conditional on Z_i\n  prob_sim &lt;- exp(lp)/(1+exp(lp))\n  \n  # Simulation of the counts from the Binomial mixed model\n  y_i_sim &lt;- rbinom(n_sim, size = bin_denom, prob = prob_sim)\n  \n  # Empirical variance from the simulated counts\n  var_data[j] &lt;- var(y_i_sim)\n}\n\n# Probabilities from the standard Binomial model (Z_i = 0)\nprobs_binomial &lt;- exp(beta0)/(1+exp(beta0))\n\n# Variance from the standard Binomial model\nvar_bimomial &lt;- bin_denom*probs_binomial*(1-probs_binomial)\n\n\nmatplot(beta0, cbind(var_data, var_bimomial), type = \"b\", pch = 20,\n        lty = \"solid\", ylab = \"Variance\", xlab = expression(beta[0]))\nlegend(-3, 80, c(\"Binomial mixed model\", \"Standard Binomial model\"),\n       col=1:2, lty = \"solid\", cex = 0.75)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6: Plot of the variances of the standard Binomial model and the Binomial mixed model (see Equation 3.8) against \\(\\beta_0\\)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6 shows the results of the simulation. In this figure, the red line corresponds to the variance of a standard Binomial model, obtained by setting \\(Z_i=0\\) and computed as \\(n_i \\mu_i (1-\\mu_i)\\) with \\(\\mu_i = \\exp\\{\\beta_0\\}/(1+\\exp\\{\\beta_0\\})\\). As expected, this plot shows that the variance of the simulated counts from the mixed model in Equation 3.8 exhibit a larger variance than would be expected under the standard Binomial model. It also indicates that the chosen value for the variance of \\(Z_i\\) of \\(\\tau^2 = 0.1\\) corresponds to a significant amount of dispersion. One way to relate \\(\\tau^2\\) to the amount of overdispersion is by considering that, following from the properties of a univariate Gaussian distribution, a priori the \\(Z_i\\) will take values between \\(-1.96 \\sqrt{\\tau^2}\\) and \\(+1.96 \\sqrt{\\tau^2}\\) with approximately 95\\(\\%\\) probability. That implies that \\(\\exp\\{Z_i\\}\\), which expresses the effect of the random effects on the odds ratios, will be with 95\\(\\%\\) probability between \\(\\exp\\{-1.96 \\sqrt{\\tau^2}\\}\\) and \\(\\exp\\{+1.96 \\sqrt{\\tau^2}\\}\\). By replacing \\(\\tau^2\\) with the chosen values for the simulation, those two becomes about 0.54 and 1.86, meaning that with the \\(Z_i\\) with \\(95\\%\\) probability will have a multiplicative effect on the odds ratios between \\(0.54\\) and \\(1.86\\).\nWe encourage you to do Exercise 1 and Exercise 2 at the end of this chapter, to further explore how generalized linear mixed models can be used as a tool to account for overdispersion.\n\n3.1.2.1 Maximum likelihood estimation of generalized linear mixed models\nWe now illustrate how fit a generalize linear mixed, using the anopheles data-set as an example. We then consider two models, an intercept-only model and one that uses elevation as a covariate. Let \\(\\mu(x_i)\\) be the number of mosquitoes captured at a location \\(x_i\\); then the linear predictor with elevation as a covariate takes the form \\[\n\\log\\{\\mu_i\\} = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} d(x_i) + Z_i\n\\] where \\(d(x_i)\\) indicates the elevation in meters at location \\(x_i\\) and the \\(Z_i\\) are independent and identically distributed Gaussian variables with mean 0 and variance \\(\\tau^2\\). The model with an intercept only is simply obtained by setting \\(\\beta_1 = 0\\).\nWe carry out the estimation in R using the glmer function from the lme4 package (see Bates et al. (2015) for a detailed tutorial).\n\n# Create the ID of the location\nanopheles$ID_loc &lt;- 1:nrow(anopheles)\n\n# Poisson mixed model with elevation\nfit_glmer_elev &lt;- glmer(An.gambiae ~ scale(elevation) + (1|ID_loc), family = poisson, \n                        data = anopheles, nAGQ = 25)\n\n# Poisson mixed model with intercept only\nfit_glmer_elev_int &lt;- glmer(An.gambiae ~ (1|ID_loc), family = poisson, \n                        data = anopheles, nAGQ = 25)\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Exploring residual spatial correlation"

Below we provide a more detailed explanation of the pre-requisites for each of these three fields.\n\n1.2.1 Topics in probability\nBasics probability theory is important to fully understand the content of this book. In particular, you should have knowledge of: the general definition and properties of continuous and discrete distribution; how the describe the properties of probability distributions through their mean, variance and skeweness; the concepts of stochastic dependence and correaltion; the distinction between marginal and conditional distributions; the basic properties of the Gaussian, Binomial and Poisson distributions; the definition and properties of the multivariate Gaussian distribution. The redear can find an extensive explanation and illustrations with examples of all these topics in Ross (2013).\n\n\n1.2.2 Topics in statistics\nLikelihood-based inference (whether frequensist or Bayesian) provides the theoretical bedrock for the estimation of almost any statistical model. In this book will focus on maximum likelihood estimation methods of inference. Extensive use of the notions of point and interval estimates obtained using the maximum likelihood estimation methods will be made through the book. Recommended readings include chapters 1, 2 and 4 of Pawitan (2001).\nGood prior knowledge of Generalized linear models (GLMs) is essential, as the geostatistical modelling framework builds on these as an extension. Before embarking on the use of this book, we thus encourage you to review the basic theory of GLMs and, in particular, how these are applied and interpreted. In this book, we will cover examples that will model continuously measured outcomes and counts. Hence, good understanding of linear regression modelling and modelling of counts data using Binomial and Poisson regression should be the main focus of the review. For comprehensive overview of GLMs and their implementation in R, we refer you to Dobson and Barnett (2008).\n\n\n1.2.3 Topics in R programming\nAlthough this book does not require to possess advanced skills in R programming, it is important you have good knowledge in the following topics: creation and manipulation of vectors and matrices; logical vectors; character vectors; handling of lists and data frame objects; reading data into R; graphical procedures. A very large amount of freely available material covering these topics can be found online. Our recommendation is to start from the manual “An introduction to R” of the Comprehensive R Archive Network available at this link, available at R manual."

For this reason its spread and source must be regularly monitored. To assess the extent of the contamination in an area, measurements of lead are often taken from plants. The data here considered (Figure 1.1) consist of 132 locations of moss samples collected in 2000, in and around Galicia, a region in the North-Western part of Spain. One of the objectives of this survey was to establish the spatial pattern of lead concentration in Galicia so as to better identify possible sources of contamination; fore more information, see Fernández, Rey, and Carballeira (2000).\nIn this case, geostatistical modelling can be used to predict the lead concentration across Galicia and allows to disentangle variation which is purely random, possibly due to measurement error, and genuine spatial variation, which is our main object of interest.\nThis data-set will be used in this book to show how to carry out the spatial analysis of continuously measured variables using linear geostatistical models.\n\n\n1.4.2 River-blindness in Liberia\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: River-blindness data from a cross-sectional survey carried out in Liberia.\n\n\n\nIn low-resource settings, where disease registries are typically absent, cross-sectional surveys are an essential monitoring tool that enables the estimation of the disease burden in a population of interest. The data considered in this example (Figure 1.2) have been collected as part of an Africa-wide initiative called the Rapid Epidemiological Mapping of Onchocerchiasis (REMO) carried out in 2011 in 20 African countries (Zouré et al. 2014). The goal of REMO is to identify areas where river-blindness (or onchocerchiasis), a disease transmitted by black flies who breed along fast flowing rivers, is still a public health problem. In this context, it is especially of interest to identify communities with a prevalence above 20% and for treatment is urgently needed.\nIn this book, we will use data collected from Liberia to model nodule prevalence, which is based on a alternative and cheaper diagnostic technique for river-blindness. In the analysis of this data-set, we will illustrate how to formulate and fit Binomial geostatistical models, and how these can be used to predict prevalence within a region of interest.\n\n\n1.4.3 Malaria in the Western Kenyan Highlands\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Malaria prevalence data from a cross-sectional survey carried out in Nyanza Province, in the Western Highlands of Kenya.\n\n\n\nMalaria is one of deadliest diseases that affects populations living in tropical and subtropical countries. It is caused by a parasite of the genus Plasmodium which is transmitted through the infectious bite of female Anopheles mosquitoes. In the following chapters, we shall analyse a data-set from a cross-sectional community survey carried out in July 2010 in Nyanza Province, in the Western Highlands of Kenya (Stevenson 2013).\nWhat distinguishes this from the other examples data-sets is that the data contain both individual-level and household-level information. The outcome of interest is the result from a rapid diagnostic test for malaria which. In the book, we will illustrate how to account for the the hierarchical structure of the data and the binary nature of the outcome at each of the stages of the geostatistical analysis.\n\n\n1.4.4 Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes in Southern Cameroon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: Map of the collected number of Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes in an area of Southern Cameroon.\n\n\n\nIn studies of vector-borne and zoonotic diseases, understanding of the vector distribution can help to better guide the decision-making process for the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of control programmes. Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes are one of the main vectors for malaria transmission in sub-Saharan Africa. Their distribution over space is affected by several environmental and climatic factors, including temperature, humidity and vegetation.\nThe data-set on mosquitoes (Figure 1.4) that will use in the book consists of a sub-set taken from a large database (Tene Fossog et al. 2015). This was assembled in order to understand how the environment affects the distribution of different species of Anopheles mosquitoes in sub-Saharan Africa. This example data-set will be used to illustrate the application of Poisson geostatistical models for mapping mosquitoes abundance."

    "text": "1.5 Geostatistical problems and geostatistical models\nWhat the examples of the previous section have in common is that, in each case, the goal of statistical analysis is to draw inferences on an unobserved spatially continuous surface using data collected from a finite set of locations. The lead concentration in Galicia, the prevalence for river-blindness in Liberia and the abundance of A. gambiae mosquitoes in Cameroon can all be represented as spatially continuous processes that originate from the combined effects of environmental factors. We denote this class of inferential problems as geostatistical problems for which a solution can be found through the development and application of suitable geostatistical models, which are the subject of this book.\nAs one can soon realize, geostatistical problems are not unique to global health but arise in many other fields of science, including economics, physics, biology, geology and others. It thus comes to no surprise that geostatistics was initially developed in the South African mining industry in the 1950s (Krige 1951). This was then further developed as a self-contained discipline by Georges Matheron and other researchers at Fontainebleau, in France (Matheron 1963; Chilès and Delfiner 2016). In Watson (1971) and Watson (1972) a first connection is drawn between geostatistics and the prediction of stochastic processes. However, it is only with Ripley (1981) and then Cressie (1991) that geostatistics is explicitly brought into a classical statistical framework for the analysis of spatially referenced data. Diggle, Tawn, and Moyeed (1998) coined the term model-based geostastics and introduced this as belonging to the general class of generalized linear mixed models (Breslow and Clayton 1993), while emphasizing the use of likelihood-based methods of inference. As in Diggle, Tawn, and Moyeed (1998), also in this book, we advocate the application of model-based geostistical models as a class of parametric statistical models on which inference can be carried out using either maximum likelihood estimation or Bayesian methods.\nMore precisely, our attention will be directed at the class of generalized linear geostatistical models, or GLGM. To formally specify this, we first define the random variables \\(S\\), a spatial stochastic process, and the random variable \\(Y= (Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n)\\) which correspond to the outcome observed at a set of locations \\(X = (x_1, \\ldots, x_n)\\). Let us use \\([A]\\) to denote “the distribution of the random variable \\(A\\)”. To formulate a GLGM, we should then specify the joint distribution of \\(S\\) and \\(Y\\), which we write as\n\\[\n[Y, S] = [S] [Y | S].\n\\tag{1.1}\\]\nOn the right-hand side of the equation above, we have factorized the joint distribution of \\(Y\\) and \\(S\\), as the product between the marginal distribution of \\(S\\) and the conditional distribution of \\(Y\\) given \\(S\\). Hence, the formulation of a GLGM can be break down into the tasks of formulating \\([S]\\) and \\([Y | S]\\).\nIn defining \\([S]\\), throughout the book, we shall assume that this is a zero-mean stationary and isotropic Gaussian process. In other words, these assumptions impose that the joint distribution of \\(S(X) = (S(x_1),\\ldots,S(x_n))\\), i.e. the process \\(S\\) at the sampled locations \\(x_1, \\ldots, x_n\\), is invariant with respect to rations and translations of the locations \\(X\\). In practical terms, the main implication of this is that, for any pair of locations \\(x_i\\) and \\(x_j\\) the correlation function \\(\\rho(\\cdot)\\) between \\(S(x_i)\\) and \\(S(x_j)\\) is purely a function of the Euclidean distance, \\(u_{ij}\\), between \\(x_i\\) and \\(x_j\\), i.e.\n\\[\n{\\rm cov}\\{S(x_i), S(x_j)\\} = \\sigma^2\\rho(u_{ij}),\n\\tag{1.2}\\]\nwhere \\(\\sigma^2\\) is the variance of \\(S(x)\\) for all \\(x\\). In Chapter 3, we will look more closely at what type of correlation functions can be used for \\(\\rho(\\cdot)\\) and how these affect our predictive inferences. Furthermore, the fact that assume the process \\(S\\) to have mean zero is because this is process acts as a residual term in our modelling of \\(Y\\). This aspect will be reiterated several times in the following chapters, as it as important implications for the interpretation of the other components of a geostatistical model, as well understanding the results of the analysis.\nFinally, we model \\([Y | S]\\), i.e. the distribution of \\(Y\\) given \\(S\\), is modeled as a set of mutually independent distributions which belong the exponential family, as defined in classical generalized linear modelling framework (Nelder and Wedderburn 1972). It then follows that, we can write \\([Y | S]\\) as\n\\[\n[Y | S] = \\prod_{i=1}^n [Y_i | S(x_i)].\n\\tag{1.3}\\]\nThe final step then consists of specifying a distribution for \\([Y_i | S(x_i)]\\). Table 1.2 gives the range, mean and variance the three specifications for $[Y_i | S(x_i)]$$ which we will consider in this book. In Table 1.2, the canonical function, say \\(g(\\cdot)\\), denotes the natural transformation of the mean component \\(\\mu_i\\) that allows us to introduce both covariates and the spatial process \\(S(x_i)\\) into the model so as to explain the variation in \\(\\mu_i\\) as\n\\[\ng(\\mu_i) = d(x_i)^\\top \\beta + S(x_i).\n\\tag{1.4}\\]\nwhere \\(d(x_i)\\) is a vector of spatially referenced covariates with associated regression coefficients \\(\\beta\\). Finally, the quantity \\(m_i\\), which appears in the formulation of the Binomial and Poisson distributions, is an offset quantity and is used to account for the number of tests or the population size at a given location \\(x_i\\).\n\n\nTable 1.2: Type of outcomes \\(Y_{i}\\) considered in this book.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistribution\nRange of \\(Y_i\\)\nMean of \\([Y_i | S(x_i)]\\)\nVariance of \\([Y_i | S(x_i)]\\)\nCanonical link\n\n\n\n\nGaussian\n\\((-\\infty, +\\infty)\\)\n\\(\\mu_i\\)\n\\(\\tau^2\\)\n\\(g(\\mu_i) = \\mu_i\\)\n\n\nBinomial\n\\(1,\\dots,m_i\\)\n\\(m_i\\mu_i\\)\n\\(m_i\\mu_i(1-\\mu_i)\\)\n\\(g(\\mu_i) = \\log\\{ \\mu_i/(1-\\mu_i) \\}\\)\n\n\nPoisson\n\\(1,2,\\ldots,\\infty\\)\n\\(m_i\\mu_i\\)\n\\(m_i\\mu_i\\)\n\\(g(\\mu_i) = \\log\\{ \\mu_i \\}\\)\n\n\n\n\nBased on the formulation in (1.4), we can see that \\(S(x_i)\\) quantifies residual spatial effects on \\(\\mu_i\\) that have not been accounted for by the covariates \\(d(x_i)\\). In an ideal scenario, the covariates \\(d(x_i)\\) should explain all the spatial variation without the need for \\(S(x_i)\\). Although this unrealistic, in practice we may be able to most of the variation in \\(\\mu_i\\) through \\(d(x_i)\\) and, hence, reduce \\(S(x_i)\\) to a negligible component. In Chapter 2, we will show how a thorough exploratory analysis can help to understand whether we have come close to that ideal scenario or, if instead, we need the use of GLGM to model the data.\nThe model described in (1.4) can be seen as the most basic GLGM that can be used for a geostatistical analysis. As we will see in the analysis of some of the examples and, in Chapter 6, for the case studies, extensions of this model will be required to accommodate the intrinsic non-spatial random variation of the data which is not captured by the covariates.\nThe types of problems that statistical models are applied to can be distinguished into three main categories: prediction problems; explanatory problems; problems of hypothesis testing. Most of the times, geostatistical problems tend to fall under the first category, where the goal is make predictive inferences on the process \\(S(x)\\) at location \\(x\\), which is usually outside of the set of sampled locations. However, as will illustrate in the later chapters, geostatistical models play an important also in the other two types of problems. In particular, we will show that spatial correlation can have a substantial impact on the point estimates and standard errors for \\(\\beta\\). Hence, if the goal of the analysis is explain the relationship between a covariate \\(d(x)\\) with the mean component \\(\\mu\\)."

The exploratory analysis of the data is an essential first step that is used to understand the empirical associations between risk factors and the the health outcome of interest. In our case, this first stage is also used to justify the use of geostatistical models by questioning the underlying assumptions of standard generalized linear models. Based on the results obtained from the exploration of the data, we then formulate a suitable statistical model and estimate its parameters using likelihood based methods of inference. These also allows us to obtain uncertainty measures about the strength of associations of regression relationships and the other model parameters that define the shape of the spatial correlation in the data. Following the estimation of the model, we then proceed to validate its underlying assumptions using suitable diagnostics that assess whether the model can later be sufficiently trusted to represent the observed variation in the modelled outcome. At this stage, if the diagnostics checks yield results that indicate the incompatibility of the model with the data, we then back to the stage of model formulation and address the issues arisen from the validation stage. If instead, we do not find any evidence against the fitted model we can proceed to carry out sptatial prediction. At this stage, it is important to define suitable predictive targets that can help us to better answer the original research question and better assist the decision making process. The final step of visualization of uncertainty plays an important role in geostatistical analysis in order to convey the main findings of the study in an effective and easy-to-understand way for a wider audience which also consists of non-experts.\nIn the remainder of this book, each chapter focuses on a specific stage as shown in Figure 1.5. We treat visualization of uncertainty together with spatial prediction in Chapter 5.\nChapter 2 will provide an overview of how to handle saptial data in R, in particular raster and shape files. The skills learned in this chapter will be applied throughout the book, and will especially be useful in Chapter 5 and Chapter 6 for generating predictive maps of the modelled outcome.\nChapter 3 focuses on the model building process and estimation of geostatistical models. This chapter will show how to carry out initial exploratory analyses of the data to inform the formulation of suitable geostatistical models and how these can be fitted using maximum likelihood estimation methods.\nChapter 4 illustrated the use of methods that can be used to validate the assumptions and calibration of statistical models.\nChapter 5 shows how geostatistical models can be used to carry out spatial prediction of a health outcome of interest both on a spatially continuous and spatially aggregated scales.\nFinally, Chapter 6 presents the application of all the methods illustrated in the previous chapters to three additional data-sets. This chapter offers a summary of the content of book by putting together all the stages in the geostatistical analyses for each of the three case studies, and illustrates additional functionalities of the RiskMap R package not covered in the previous chapters.\n\n\n\n\nBreslow, N.

By editing the code for the simulation shown in Section 3.1.2, generate a graph as in Figure 3.6 under the two following scenarios: \\(i\\)) \\(\\tau^2 = 0.2\\) and \\(n_i=100\\); \\(ii\\)) \\(\\tau^2 = 0.1\\) and \\(n_i = 1\\). How does the variance of \\(Y_i\\) change under \\(i\\)) and \\(ii\\)) in comparison to Figure 3.6? How do you explain the differences?\nSimilarly to the previous exercise, consider a Poisson mixed model with linear predictor \\[\n\\log\\left\\{\\mu_i\\right\\} = \\beta_0 + Z_i,\n\\] where \\(Z_i\\) are a set of mutually independent Gaussian variables with mean 0 and variance \\(\\tau^2\\). Using the code shown in Section 3.1.2, carry out a simulation study to compute the variance of \\(Y_i\\) and generate a graph similar to Figure 3.6 to compare the variance of the Poisson mixed model with that of a standard Poisson model. Generate the graph for different values of \\(\\tau^2\\) and summarize your findings. NOTE: In this simulation the offset \\(n_i\\) can be set to 1.\n\n\n\n\n\nBates, Douglas, Martin Mächler, Ben Bolker, and Steve Walker. 2015. “Fitting Linear Mixed-Effects Models Using lme4.” Journal of Statistical Software 67 (1): 1–48. https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v067.i01.\n\n\nBowman, A.
