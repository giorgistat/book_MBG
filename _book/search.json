    "text": "4.1 Exploring association with risk factors\nAssessment of the association between the health outcome of interest and non-categorical (i.e. continuous) risk factors, can be carried through scatter plots. The graphical exploration of the empirical association between the outcome and the covariates is especially useful to identify non-linear patterns in the relationship which should then be accounted for in the model formulation.\nLet us first consider the example of the riverblindess data in Liberia, and examine the association between prevalence and elevation. We first generate a plot of the prevalence against the measured elevation at each of the sample locations\n\nliberia$logit &lt;- liberia$npos/liberia$ntest\n\nggplot(liberia, aes(x = elevation, y = logit)) + geom_point() +\n  labs(x=\"Elevation (meters)\",y=\"Empirical logit\")\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Scatter plot of the empirical prevalence for riverblindess against elevation, measured in meters.\n\n\n\n\nThe plot shown in Figure 4.1 shows that, when elevation increases from 0 to around 100 meters, prevalence rapidly increases to around 0.25 and, for larger values in elevation, the relationship levels off. This begs the question of how we can account for this in a regression model. However, the plot in Figure 4.1 cannot be used to inform this decision because, when modelling prevalence data, regression relationships are specified on the logit-transformed prevalence (log-odds) scale; see Section ?sec-geostat-models . The approach we follow to explore relationships in the case of prevalence data is to the so called empirical logit, defined as\n\\[\ne_{i} = \\log\\left\\{\\frac{y_i + 1/2}{n_i - y_i + 1/2}\\right\\}\n\\tag{4.1}\\]\nwhere \\(y_i\\) are the number of individuals who tested positive for riverblindness and \\(n_i\\) is the total number of people tested at a location. The reason for using the empirical logit, rather than the standard logit transformation applied directly to the empirical prevalence, is that it allows to generate finite values for empirical prevalence values of 0 and 1, for which the standard logit function is not defined.\n\nggplot(liberia, aes(x = elevation, y = logit)) + geom_point() +\n  labs(x=\"Elevation (meters)\",y=\"Empirical logit\") +\n  stat_smooth(method = \"gam\", formula = y ~ s(x),se=FALSE)+\n  stat_smooth(method = \"lm\", formula = y ~ x + I((x-150)*(x&gt;150)),\n              col=\"red\",lty=\"dashed\",se=FALSE) +\n  stat_smooth(method = \"lm\", formula = y ~ log(x),\n              col=\"green\",lty=\"dashed\",se=FALSE)\n \n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Scatter plot of the empirical prevalence for riverblindess against elevation, measured in meters."

Below we provide a more detailed explanation of the pre-requisites for each of these three fields.\n\n1.2.1 Topics in probability\nBasics probability theory is important to fully understand the content of this book. In particular, you should have knowledge of: the general definition and properties of continuous and discrete distribution; how the describe the properties of probability distributions through their mean, variance and skeweness; the concepts of stochastic dependence and correaltion; the distinction between marginal and conditional distributions; the basic properties of the Gaussian, Binomial and Poisson distributions; the definition and properties of the multivariate Gaussian distribution. The redear can find an extensive explanation and illustrations with examples of all these topics in Ross (2013).\n\n\n1.2.2 Topics in statistics\nLikelihood-based inference (whether frequensist or Bayesian) provides the theoretical bedrock for the estimation of almost any statistical model. In this book will focus on maximum likelihood estimation methods of inference. Extensive use of the notions of point and interval estimates obtained using the maximum likelihood estimation methods will be made through the book. Recommended readings include chapters 1, 2 and 4 of Pawitan (2001).\nGood knowledge of Generalized linear models (GLMs) is essential, as the geostatistical modelling framework builds on these as an extension. Before embarking on the use of this book, we thus encourage you to review the basic theory of GLMs and, in particular, how these are applied and interpreted. In this book, we will cover examples that will model continuously measured outcomes and counts. Hence, good understanding of linear regression modelling and modelling of counts data using Binomial and Poisson regression should be the main focus of the review. For comprehensive overview of GLMs and their implementation in R, we refer you to Dobson and Barnett (2008).\n\n\n1.2.3 Topics in R programming\nAlthough this book does not require to possess advanced skills in R programming, it is important you have good knowledge in the following topics: creation and manipulation of vectors and matrices; logical vectors; character vectors; handling of lists and data frame objects; reading data into R; graphical procedures. A very large amount of freely available material covering these topics can be found online. Our recommendation is to start from the manual “An introduction to R” of the Comprehensive R Archive Network available at this link, available at R manual."

For this reason its spread and source must be regularly monitored. To assess the extent of the contamination in an area, measurements of lead are often taken from plants. The data here considered (Figure 1.1) consist of 132 locations of moss samples collected in 2000, in and around Galicia, a region in the North-Western part of Spain. One of the objectives of this survey was to establish the spatial pattern of lead concentration in Galicia so as to better identify possible sources of contamination; fore more information, see Fernández, Rey, and Carballeira (2000).\nIn this case, geostatistical modelling can be used to predict the lead concentration across Galicia and allows to disentangle variation which is purely random, possibly due to measurement error, and genuine spatial variation, which is our main object of interest.\nThis data-set will be used in this book to show how to carry out the spatial analysis of continuously measured variables using linear geostatistical models.\n\n\n1.4.2 River-blindness in Liberia\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: River-blindness data from a cross-sectional survey carried out in Liberia.\n\n\n\nIn low-resource settings, where disease registries are typically absent, cross-sectional surveys are an essential monitoring tool that enables the estimation of the disease burden in a population of interest. The data considered in this example (Figure 1.2) have been collected as part of an Africa-wide initiative called the Rapid Epidemiological Mapping of Onchocerchiasis (REMO) carried out in 2011 in 20 African countries (Zouré et al. 2014). The goal of REMO is to identify areas where river-blindness (or onchocerchiasis), a disease transmitted by black flies who breed along fast flowing rivers, is still a public health problem. In this context, it is especially of interest to identify communities with a prevalence above 20% and for treatment is urgently needed.\nIn this book, we will use data collected from Liberia to model nodule prevalence, which is based on a alternative and cheaper diagnostic technique for river-blindness. In the analysis of this data-set, we will illustrate how to formulate and fit Binomial geostatistical models, and how these can be used to predict prevalence within a region of interest.\n\n\n1.4.3 Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes in Southern Cameroon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Map of the collected number of Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes in an area of Southern Cameroon.\n\n\n\nIn studies of vector-borne and zoonotic diseases, understanding of the vector distribution can help to better guide the decision-making process for the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of control programmes. Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes are one of the main vectors for malaria transmission in sub-Saharan Africa. Their distribution over space is affected by several environmental and climatic factors, including temperature, humidity and vegetation.\nThe data-set on mosquitoes (Figure 1.3) that will use in the book consists of a sub-set taken from a large database (Tene Fossog et al. 2015). This was assembled in order to understand how the environment affects the distribution of different species of Anopheles mosquitoes in sub-Saharan Africa. This example data-set will be used to illustrate the application of Poisson geostatistical models for mapping mosquitoes abundance."

    "section": "1.5 Geostatistical problems and geostatistical models",
    "text": "1.5 Geostatistical problems and geostatistical models\nWhat the examples of the previous section have in common is that, in each case, the goal of statistical analysis is to draw inferences on an unobserved spatially continuous surface using data collected from a finite set of locations. The lead concentration in Galicia, the prevalence for river-blindness in Liberia and the abundance of A. gambiae mosquitoes in Cameroon can all be represented as spatially continuous processes that originate from the combined effects of environmental factors. We denote this class of inferential problems as geostatistical problems for which a solution can be found through the development and application of suitable geostatistical models, which are the subject of this book.\nAs one can soon realize, geostatistical problems are not unique to global health but arise in many other fields of science, including economics, physics, biology, geology and others. It thus comes to no surprise that geostatistics was initially developed in the South African mining industry in the 1950s (Krige 1951). This was then further developed as a self-contained discipline by Georges Matheron and other researchers at Fontainebleau, in France (Matheron 1963; Chilès and Delfiner 2016). In Watson (1971) and Watson (1972) a first connection is drawn between geostatistics and the prediction of stochastic processes. However, it is only with Ripley (1981) and then Cressie (1991) that geostatistics is explicitly brought into a classical statistical framework for the analysis of spatially referenced data. Diggle, Tawn, and Moyeed (1998) coined the term model-based geostastics and introduced this as belonging to the general class of generalized linear mixed models (Breslow and Clayton 1993), while emphasizing the use of likelihood-based methods of inference. As in Diggle, Tawn, and Moyeed (1998), also in this book, we advocate the application of model-based geostistical models as a class of parametric statistical models on which inference can be carried out using either maximum likelihood estimation or Bayesian methods.\nMore precisely, our attention will be directed at the class of generalized linear geostatistical models, or GLGM. To formally specify this, we first define the random variables \\(S\\), a spatial stochastic process, and the random variable \\(Y= (Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n)\\) which correspond to the outcome observed at a set of locations \\(X = (x_1, \\ldots, x_n)\\). Let us use \\([A]\\) to denote “the distribution of the random variable \\(A\\)”. To formulate a GLGM, we should then specify the joint distribution of \\(S\\) and \\(Y\\), which we write as\n\\[\n[Y, S] = [S] [Y | S].\n\\tag{1.1}\\]\nOn the right-hand side of the equation above, we have factorized the joint distribution of \\(Y\\) and \\(S\\), as the product between the marginal distribution of \\(S\\) and the conditional distribution of \\(Y\\) given \\(S\\). Hence, the formulation of a GLGM can be break down into the tasks of formulating \\([S]\\) and \\([Y | S]\\).\nIn defining \\([S]\\), throughout the book, we shall assume that this is a zero-mean stationary and isotropic Gaussian process. In other words, these assumptions impose that the joint distribution of \\(S(X) = (S(x_1),\\ldots,S(x_n))\\), i.e. the process \\(S\\) at the sampled locations \\(x_1, \\ldots, x_n\\), is invariant with respect to rations and translations of the locations \\(X\\). In practical terms, the main implication of this is that, for any pair of locations \\(x_i\\) and \\(x_j\\) the correlation function \\(\\rho(\\cdot)\\) between \\(S(x_i)\\) and \\(S(x_j)\\) is purely a function of the Euclidean distance, \\(u_{ij}\\), between \\(x_i\\) and \\(x_j\\), i.e.\n\\[\n{\\rm cov}\\{S(x_i), S(x_j)\\} = \\sigma^2\\rho(u_{ij}),\n\\tag{1.2}\\]\nwhere \\(\\sigma^2\\) is the variance of \\(S(x)\\) for all \\(x\\). In Chapter 3, we will look more closely at what type of correlation functions can be used for \\(\\rho(\\cdot)\\) and how these affect our predictive inferences. Furthermore, the fact that assume the process \\(S\\) to have mean zero is because this is process acts as a residual term in our modelling of \\(Y\\). This aspect will be reiterated several times in the following chapters, as it as important implications for the interpretation of the other components of a geostatistical model, as well understanding the results of the analysis.\nFinally, we model \\([Y | S]\\), i.e. the distribution of \\(Y\\) given \\(S\\), is modeled as a set of mutually independent distributions which belong the exponential family, as defined in classical generalized linear modelling framework (Nelder and Wedderburn 1972). It then follows that, we can write \\([Y | S]\\) as\n\\[\n[Y | S] = \\prod_{i=1}^n [Y_i | S(x_i)].\n\\tag{1.3}\\]\nThe final step then consists of specifying a distribution for \\([Y_i | S(x_i)]\\). Table 1.2 gives the range, mean and variance the three specifications for $[Y_i | S(x_i)]$$ which we will consider in this book. In Table 1.2, the canonical function, say \\(g(\\cdot)\\), denotes the natural transformation of the mean component \\(\\mu_i\\) that allows us to introduce both covariates and the spatial process \\(S(x_i)\\) into the model so as to explain the variation in \\(\\mu_i\\) as\n\\[\ng(\\mu_i) = d(x_i)^\\top \\beta + S(x_i).\n\\tag{1.4}\\]\nwhere \\(d(x_i)\\) is a vector of spatially referenced covariates with associated regression coefficients \\(\\beta\\). Finally, the quantity \\(m_i\\), which appears in the formulation of the Binomial and Poisson distributions, is an offset quantity and is used to account for the number of tests or the population size at a given location \\(x_i\\).\n\n\nTable 1.2: Type of outcomes \\(Y_{i}\\) considered in this book.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistribution\nRange of \\(Y_i\\)\nMean of \\([Y_i | S(x_i)]\\)\nVariance of \\([Y_i | S(x_i)]\\)\nCanonical link\n\n\n\n\nGaussian\n\\((-\\infty, +\\infty)\\)\n\\(\\mu_i\\)\n\\(\\tau^2\\)\n\\(g(\\mu_i) = \\mu_i\\)\n\n\nBinomial\n\\(1,\\dots,m_i\\)\n\\(m_i\\mu_i\\)\n\\(m_i\\mu_i(1-\\mu_i)\\)\n\\(g(\\mu_i) = \\log\\{ \\mu_i/(1-\\mu_i) \\}\\)\n\n\nPoisson\n\\(1,2,\\ldots,\\infty\\)\n\\(m_i\\mu_i\\)\n\\(m_i\\mu_i\\)\n\\(g(\\mu_i) = \\log\\{ \\mu_i \\}\\)\n\n\n\n\nBased on the formulation in (1.4), we can see that \\(S(x_i)\\) quantifies residual spatial effects on \\(\\mu_i\\) that have not been accounted for by the covariates \\(d(x_i)\\). In an ideal scenario, the covariates \\(d(x_i)\\) should explain all the spatial variation without the need for \\(S(x_i)\\). Although this unrealistic, in practice we may be able to most of the variation in \\(\\mu_i\\) through \\(d(x_i)\\) and, hence, reduce \\(S(x_i)\\) to a negligible component. In Chapter 2, we will show how a thorough exploratory analysis can help to understand whether we have come close to that ideal scenario or, if instead, we need the use of GLGM to model the data.\nThe model described in (1.4) can be seen as the most basic GLGM that can be used for a geostatistical analysis. As we will see in the analysis of some of the examples and, in Chapter 6, for the case studies, extensions of this model will be required to accommodate the intrinsic non-spatial random variation of the data which is not captured by the covariates.\nThe types of problems that statistical models are applied to can be distinguished into three main categories: prediction problems; explanatory problems; problems of hypothesis testing. Most of the times, geostatistical problems tend to fall under the first category, where the goal is make predictive inferences on the process \\(S(x)\\) at location \\(x\\), which is usually outside of the set of sampled locations. However, as will illustrate in the later chapters, geostatistical models play an important also in the other two types of problems. In particular, we will show that spatial correlation can have a substantial impact on the point estimates and standard errors for \\(\\beta\\). Hence, if the goal of the analysis is explain the relationship between a covariate \\(d(x)\\) with the mean component \\(\\mu\\)."

The exploratory analysis of the data is an essential first step that is used to understand the empirical associations between risk factors and the the health outcome of interest. In our case, this first stage is also used to justify the use of geostatistical models by questioning the underlying assumptions of standard generalized linear models. Based on the results obtained from the exploration of the data, we then formulate a suitable statistical model and estimate its parameters using likelihood based methods of inference. These also allows us to obtain uncertainty measures about the strength of associations of regression relationships and the other model parameters that define the shape of the spatial correlation in the data. Following the estimation of the model, we then proceed to validate its underlying assumptions using suitable diagnostics that assess whether the model can later be sufficiently trusted to represent the observed variation in the modelled outcome. At this stage, if the diagnostics checks yield results that indicate the incompatibility of the model with the data, we then back to the stage of model formulation and address the issues arisen from the validation stage. If instead, we do not find any evidence against the fitted model we can proceed to carry out sptatial prediction. At this stage, it is important to define suitable predictive targets that can help us to better answer the original research question and better assist the decision making process. The final step of visualization of uncertainty plays an important role in geostatistical analysis in order to convey the main findings of the study in an effective and easy-to-understand way for a wider audience which also consists of non-experts.\nIn the remainder of this book, each chapter focuses on a specific stage as shown in Figure 1.4. We treat visualization of uncertainty together with spatial prediction in Chapter 5.\nChapter 1 provides statistical methods for the exploration of geostatistical data-sets, especially on the detection of residual spatial correlation. In addition, we will also cover the handling and visualization of spatial data in R. The skills learned in this will also be useful in Chapter 5 and Chapter 6 for generating predictive maps of the modelled outcome.\nChapter 2 focuses on the estimation of geostatistical models and will provide an overview of Monte Carlo based methods for maximum likelihood estimation.\nChapter 3 illustrated the use of methods that can be used to validate the assumptions and calibration of statistical models.\nChapter 5 shows how geostatistical models can be used to carry out spatial prediction of a health outcome of interest both on a spatially continuous and spatially aggregated scales.\nFinally, Chapter 6 presents the application of all the methods illustrated in the previous chapters to three additional data-sets. This chapter offers a summary of the content of book by putting together all the stages in the geostatistical analyses for each of the three case studies, and illustrates additional functionalities of the RiskMap R package not covered in the previous chapters.\n\n\n\n\nBreslow, N.
