    "text": "1.1 Objectives of this book\nThe overall aim of this book is to provide you with the skills to perform a geostatistical analysis of a data-set using the R software environment. As you work your way through the book, you will learn to:\n\nexplore geo-statistical data-sets using graphical procedures and summary statitics;\nformulate and fit geostatistical models using the maximum likelihood estimation method;\ncarry out prediction of health outcomes at different spatial scales;\nvisualize and interpret the results from geostatical models;\nmodel the relationships between spatially referenced risk factors and the health outcome of interest;\nvalidate geostatistical models.\n\nAlthough the focus of this book is on public health, the statistical ideas, as well as the software used, can also be applied for the analysis of geostatistical data-sets arising from other scientific fields."

    "section": "1.2 Pre-requisites for using this book",
    "text": "1.2 Pre-requisites for using this book\nTo effectively understand and use the material presented in this book, it is expected that you should possess prior knowledge of basic probability theory, foundational topics in statistical modelling and R programming. Below we provide a more detailed explanation of the pre-requisites for each of these three fields.\n\n1.2.1 Topics in probability\nBasics probability theory is important to fully understand the content of this book. In particular, you should have knowledge of: the general definition and properties of continuous and discrete distribution; how the describe the properties of probability distributions through their mean, variance and skeweness; the concepts of stochastic dependence and correaltion; the distinction between marginal and conditional distributions; the basic properties of the Gaussian, Binomial and Poisson distributions; the definition and properties of the multivariate Gaussian distribution. The redear can find an extensive explanation and illustrations with examples of all these topics in Ross (2013).\n\n\n1.2.2 Topics in statistics\nLikelihood-based inference (whether frequensist or Bayesian) provides the theoretical bedrock for the estimation of almost any statistical model. In this book will focus on maximum likelihood estimation methods of inference. Extensive use of the notions of point and interval estimates obtained using the maximum likelihood estimation methods will be made through the book. Recommended readings include chapters 1, 2 and 4 of Pawitan (2001).\nGood knowledge of Generalized linear models (GLMs) is essential, as the geostatistical modelling framework builds on these as an extension. Before embarking on the use of this book, we thus encourage you to review the basic theory of GLMs and, in particular, how these are applied and interpreted. In this book, we will cover examples that will model continuously measured outcomes and counts. Hence, good understanding of linear regression modelling and modelling of counts data using Binomial and Poisson regression should be the main focus of the review. For comprehensive overview of GLMs and their implementation in R, we refer you to Dobson and Barnett (2008).\n\n\n1.2.3 Topics in R programming\nAlthough this book does not require to possess advanced skills in R programming, it is important you have good knowledge in the following topics: creation and manipulation of vectors and matrices; logical vectors; character vectors; handling of lists and data frame objects; reading data into R; graphical procedures. A very large amount of freely available material covering these topics can be found online. Our recommendation is to start from the manual “An introduction to R” of the Comprehensive R Archive Network available at this link, available at R manual."
