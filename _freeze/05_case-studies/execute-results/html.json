It can have long-term consequences on physical growth, cognitive development, and susceptibility to disease. Monitoring childhood nutritional status is essential for evaluating the effectiveness of health interventions and informing policy decisions.\n\nTwo widely used anthropometric indicators derived from child growth measurements are:\n\n-   Height-for-Age Z-score (HAZ): A measure of stunting, which reflects chronic malnutrition. Children with a HAZ below -2 standard deviations from the WHO growth reference median are considered stunted, indicating long-term nutritional deprivation or repeated infections.\n\n-   Weight-for-Age Z-score (WAZ): A composite indicator of underweight, capturing both acute and chronic malnutrition. Children with WAZ below -2 are considered underweight. This measure is commonly used in population-based surveys because it is relatively easy to collect and interpret.\n\nThese Z-scores are calculated by comparing individual anthropometric measurements to the WHO Child Growth Standards, which were developed based on data from healthy children under optimal environmental and nutritional conditions [@who2006].\n\nGeostatistical models applied to HAZ and WAZ, or to the prevalence of stunting and underweight derived from these scores, can help answer critical questions such as: *Where is the burden of malnutrition highest? How does it relate to socioeconomic or environmental factors? And which areas should be prioritized for targeted nutritional interventions?*\n\nIn this case study, we analyse HAZ and WAZ as continuous outcomes to assess the spatial variation in child malnutrition across Ghana and its association with socioeconomic and demographic covariates.\n\n### Exploratory analysis\n\nWe begin by loading the necessary R packages and the `malnutrition` dataset. This geostatistical dataset is derived from the 2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) [@ghanaDHS2014], which provides nationally representative data on child health and nutrition. The dataset includes anthropometric measurements, household characteristics, and georeferenced sampling cluster coordinates, making it suitable for spatial analysis of child malnutrition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load packages\nlibrary(RiskMap)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\n# Load the data\ndata(malnutrition)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe explanatory variables considered in this analysis are `age` and `wealth`. Figure @fig-maln-expl displays scatterplots of the two nutritional outcomes (`HAZ` and `WAZ`) against age, alongside boxplots stratified by the three levels of the `wealth` variable.\n\nTo explore the relationship between age and nutritional status, the code below applies locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) to highlight potential non-linear trends. In addition, we fit linear splines using the function `pmax()` to model a change in slope at specified knots—2 months for HAZ and 1 month for WAZ. These change points were selected heuristically based on visual inspection of the LOESS curves.\n\nAs shown in Figure @fig-maln-expl, the linear splines (green dashed lines) closely follow the LOESS fits (solid red lines), indicating that the piecewise linear models provide an adequate approximation of the age-nutrition relationship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Filter complete cases for relevant variables\nmal <- malnutrition %>%\n  filter(!is.na(HAZ), !is.na(WAZ), !is.na(age), !is.na(wealth))\n\n# Fit spline model for HAZ with knot at 2 months\nmod_haz <- lm(HAZ ~ age + pmax(age - 2, 0), data = mal)\n\n# Fit spline model for WAZ with knot at 1 month\nmod_waz <- lm(WAZ ~ age + pmax(age - 1, 0), data = mal)\n\n# Prediction grid for HAZ\nnewdat_haz <- data.frame(age = seq(min(mal$age), max(mal$age), length.out = 200)) \nnewdat_haz$fit <- predict(mod_haz, newdata = newdat_haz)\n\n# Prediction grid for WAZ\nnewdat_waz <- data.frame(age = seq(min(mal$age), max(mal$age), length.out = 200)) \nnewdat_waz$fit <- predict(mod_waz, newdata = newdat_waz)\n\n# Plot HAZ vs Age\np1 <- ggplot(mal, aes(x = age, y = HAZ)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", colour = \"red\", se = FALSE) +\n  geom_line(data = newdat_haz, aes(x = age, y = fit), \n            colour = \"green\", linetype = \"dashed\", linewidth = 1.2) +\n  labs(title = \"HAZ vs Age\", x = \"Age (months)\", y = \"HAZ\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n# Plot WAZ vs Age\np2 <- ggplot(mal, aes(x = age, y = WAZ)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", colour = \"red\", se = FALSE) +\n  geom_line(data = newdat_waz, aes(x = age, y = fit), \n            colour = \"green\", linetype = \"dashed\", linewidth = 1.2) +\n  labs(title = \"WAZ vs Age\", x = \"Age (months)\", y = \"WAZ\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n# Boxplots for HAZ and WAZ by wealth\np3 <- ggplot(mal, aes(x = factor(wealth), y = HAZ)) +\n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"lightblue\") +\n  labs(title = \"HAZ by Wealth Group\", x = \"Wealth (1 = Poor, 3 = Rich)\", y = \"HAZ\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\np4 <- ggplot(mal, aes(x = factor(wealth), y = WAZ)) +\n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"lightgreen\") +\n  labs(title = \"WAZ by Wealth Group\", x = \"Wealth (1 = Poor, 3 = Rich)\", y = \"WAZ\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n# Combine plots\n(p1 | p2) / (p3 | p4)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Exploratory analysis of HAZ and WAZ by age and wealth.

Let $Y_{ij}$ represent either the HAZ or WAZ score for the $j$-th child in the $i$-th cluster. The model takes the following form:\n\n$$\nY_{ij} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 a_{ij} + \\beta_2 \\max\\{a_{ij} - c, 0\\} + \\beta_3 w_i + Z_i + U_{ij},\n$$ {#eq-model-haz-waz}\n\nwhere $a_{ij}$ denotes the age in months of child $j$ in cluster $i$, and $w_i$ is the wealth score associated with cluster $i$; as previously stated, the change point $c$ of the linear spline is set to 2 months for HAZ and 1 month for WAZ. The term $Z_i$ is a Gaussian random effect with mean zero and variance $\\tau^2$, capturing between-cluster variation not explained by the covariates. The error term $U_{ij}$ represents child-specific residual variation and is assumed to be Gaussian with mean zero and variance $\\omega^2$.\n\nTo fit this model, we create a cluster ID variable based on the sampling coordinates and include it as a random intercept in the `lmer` function to incorporate the term $Z_i$.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create ID for the location\nmalnutrition <- malnutrition %>%\n  group_by(lng, lat) %>%\n  mutate(loc_id = cur_group_id()) %>%\n  ungroup()\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe then fit the models using the `lmer` function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(lme4)\nhaz_lmer <- \nlmer(HAZ ~ age + pmax(age - 2, 0) + wealth + (1 | loc_id), data = malnutrition)\n\nsummary(haz_lmer)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nLinear mixed model fit by REML ['lmerMod']\nFormula: HAZ ~ age + pmax(age - 2, 0) + wealth + (1 | loc_id)\n   Data: malnutrition\n\nREML criterion at convergence: 8593.6\n\nScaled residuals: \n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-4.6407 -0.5992  0.0154  0.6098  5.6443 \n\nRandom effects:\n Groups   Name        Variance Std.Dev.\n loc_id   (Intercept) 0.06939  0.2634  \n Residual             1.39362  1.1805  \nNumber of obs: 2671, groups:  loc_id, 410\n\nFixed effects:\n                 Estimate Std.

The estimates suggest that $\\omega^2$ is more than twenty times larger than $\\tau^2$, indicating that the majority of the unexplained variation occurs at the individual child level rather than between clusters. This has important implications for interpretation: any subsequent mapping of the prevalence of stunting or underweight should acknowledge the high degree of within-cluster variability as a limitation. In particular, predictions at unsampled locations may be subject to substantial uncertainty driven by this fine-scale heterogeneity.\n\n### Assessing residual spatial correlation and model fitting\n\nWe next explore the residual spatial correlation through the empirical variogram. Hence, we extract the estimate of the random effects from @eq-model-haz-waz and input these into the `s_variogram` function that generates the empirical variogram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Extract random effects for HAZ and WAZ and combine them\nre <- data.frame(\n  loc_id = as.numeric(rownames(ranef(haz_lmer)$loc_id)),\n  Z_hat_haz = ranef(haz_lmer)$loc_id[,1],\n  Z_hat_waz = ranef(waz_lmer)$loc_id[,1]\n)\n\n# Extract one row per location with coordinates\nloc_coords <- malnutrition %>%\n  select(loc_id, lng, lat) %>%\n  distinct()\n\n# Merge coordinates into random effects\nre <- left_join(re, loc_coords, by = \"loc_id\")\n\n# Convert to sf and transform into UTM\nlibrary(sf)\nre <- st_as_sf(re, coords = c(\"lng\",\"lat\"), crs = 4326)\nre <- st_transform(re, crs = propose_utm(re))\n\n# Variogram for HAZ\nvar_haz <- s_variogram(re, \"Z_hat_haz\", scale_to_km = TRUE,\n                       n_permutation = 1000)\nvar_waz <- s_variogram(re, \"Z_hat_waz\", scale_to_km = TRUE,\n                       n_permutation = 1000)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\n# Create ggplot objects\np_haz <- plot_s_variogram(var_haz, plot_envelope = TRUE) + \n  ggtitle(\"HAZ\")\n\np_waz <- plot_s_variogram(var_waz, plot_envelope = TRUE) + \n  ggtitle(\"WAZ\")\n\np_haz + p_waz\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Empirical variograms for HAZ and WAZ based on the estimated random effects from @eq-model-haz-waz.](05_case-studies_files/figure-html/fig-maln-vari-1.png){#fig-maln-vari}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@fig-maln-vari shows the variogram for both HAZ and WAZ. In both cases, we observe that is residual spatial correlation in the data that is not explained by either age or the wealth index. We next extend the model in @eq-model-haz-waz to address this issue.\n\nFor our geostatistical analysis of HAZ and WAZ, we consider the following model:\n\n$$\nY_{ij} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 a_{ij} + \\beta_2 \\max\\{a_{ij} - c, 0\\} + \\beta_3 w_i + S(x_i) + U_{ij},\n$$\n\nwhere $S(x)$ is a zero-mean, stationary, and isotropic Gaussian process with variance $\\sigma^2$ and an exponential correlation function with scale parameter $\\phi$. In this geostatistical extension, we replace the cluster-level random effect $Z_i$ from @eq-model-haz-waz with the spatial process $S(x_i)$. The random effect $Z_i$ was previously used in the Binomial mixed model to account for unexplained variation between clusters. It is also possible to include both $S(x_i)$ and $Z_i$ in the model, so that the total unexplained variation between clusters is decomposed into a spatially structured component, $S(x_i)$, and an unstructured component, $Z_i$. However, this approach is not recommended in the initial model specification, as it may lead to identifiability issues. It can be considered later in the analysis if justified by model diagnostics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Remove missing data from the WAZ outcome\nmalnutrition <- malnutrition[complete.cases(malnutrition[,\"WAZ\"]),]\n\n# Converting the data-frame into an sf object\nmalnutrition_sf <- st_as_sf(malnutrition, coords = c(\"lng\", \"lat\"), crs = 4326)\nmalnutrition_sf <- st_transform(malnutrition_sf, crs = propose_utm(malnutrition_sf))\n\n# Maximum likelihood estimation for the HAZ and WAZ outcomes\nhaz_fit <- \nglgpm(HAZ ~ age + pmax(age - 1, 0) + wealth + gp(),\n      data=malnutrition_sf, family = \"gaussian\")\n\nwaz_fit <- \n  glgpm(HAZ ~ age + pmax(age - 1, 0) + wealth + gp(),\n        data=malnutrition_sf, family = \"gaussian\") \n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe then summarize the fit of models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(haz_fit)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nLinear geostatsitical model \n'Lower limit' and 'Upper limit' are the limits of the 95% confidence level intervals \n\n Regression coefficients \n                   Estimate Lower limit Upper limit     StdErr  z.value p.value\n(Intercept)      -0.2158950  -0.4338747   0.0020848  0.1112162  -1.9412 0.05223\nage              -1.3073560  -1.4135715  -1.2011404  0.0541926 -24.1243 < 2e-16\npmax(age - 1, 0)  1.2288215   1.1496224   1.3080207  0.0404085  30.4100 < 2e-16\nwealth            0.3520544   0.3319696   0.3721393  0.0102476  34.3550 < 2e-16\n                    \n(Intercept)      .  \nage              ***\npmax(age - 1, 0) ***\nwealth           ***\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\nOffset included into the linear predictor \n\n                         Estimate Lower limit Upper limit\nMeasuremment error var.   1.4371      1.4254      1.4489\n\n Spatial Guassian process \nMatern covariance parameters (kappa=0.5) \n                      Estimate Lower limit Upper limit\nSpatial process var.  0.069453    0.061423      0.0785\nSpatial corr. scale  36.529380   30.187727     44.2032\nVariance of the nugget effect fixed at 0 \n\n Log-likelihood: -1859.246\n\n AIC: 3718.491\n \n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(waz_fit)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nLinear geostatsitical model \n'Lower limit' and 'Upper limit' are the limits of the 95% confidence level intervals \n\n Regression coefficients \n                   Estimate Lower limit Upper limit     StdErr  z.value\n(Intercept)      -0.4580088  -0.6499668  -0.2660509  0.0979395  -4.6764\nage              -0.7295504  -0.8235412  -0.6355596  0.0479554 -15.2131\npmax(age - 1, 0)  0.7421647   0.6720850   0.8122443  0.0357556  20.7566\nwealth            0.2254477   0.2076797   0.2432157  0.0090655  24.8689\n                   p.value    \n(Intercept)      2.919e-06 ***\nage              < 2.2e-16 ***\npmax(age - 1, 0) < 2.2e-16 ***\nwealth           < 2.2e-16 ***\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\nOffset included into the linear predictor \n\n                         Estimate Lower limit Upper limit\nMeasuremment error var.   1.1253      1.1161      1.1346\n\n Spatial Guassian process \nMatern covariance parameters (kappa=0.5) \n                      Estimate Lower limit Upper limit\nSpatial process var.  0.049912    0.043750      0.0569\nSpatial corr. scale  35.836303   28.815346     44.5679\nVariance of the nugget effect fixed at 0 \n\n Log-likelihood: -1530.593\n\n AIC: 3061.187\n \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe spatial component of the models reveals a moderate degree of spatial structure in the HAZ and WAZ outcomes. For HAZ, the estimated spatial variance is approximately 0.069, while the individual-level radom effect's variance is substantially larger at around 1.437. For WAZ, the spatial variance is estimated at 0.050, compared to the variance of the individual-level radom effect's variance of 1.125. In both models, as already observed when fitting Binomial mixed models, this indicates that the majority of the residual variation is due to individual-level noise or unstructured heterogeneity rather than spatially structured effects. The relative contribution of the spatial process to the total unexplained variation is therefore relatively small. Nevertheless, geostatistical analysis remains valuable also in this context. Even when spatial effects explain only a modest proportion of the variation, the model still enables spatial prediction of the average spatial pattern for the outcome of interest across the study area. This is useful for identifying areas where child malnutrition is systematically higher or lower, guiding targeted interventions and informing resource allocation. We explore these implications further in the next section on geostatistical prediction for HAZ and WAZ.\n\n### Prediction and assessment of model calibration\n\nStunting and underweight are standard indicators used to assess child malnutrition. A child is defined as \\textit{stunted} if their height-for-age $z$-score (HAZ) is below $-2$ standard deviations from the median of the WHO Child Growth Standards, i.e., HAZ \\< -2. Similarly, a child is considered \\textit{underweight} if their weight-for-age $z$-score (WAZ) falls below $-2$, i.e., WAZ \\< -2 [@sdg2201meta2025]. These thresholds are based on the World Health Organization (WHO) growth reference standards, which provide a normative basis for assessing nutritional status in children under five years of age [@who_underweight2024].\n\nWe now define the predictive targets for stunting and underweight prevalence in terms of the adopted geostatistical model. Both indicators correspond to the probability that a child's z-score falls below $-2$, that is, $Y(x) < -2$, where $Y(x)$ denotes either the HAZ or WAZ score at location $x$. Under the model specification, the prevalence is therefore defined as\n\n$$\nT(x) = P\\left\\{ Y(x) < -2 \\,\\middle|\\, S(x) \\right\\} = \\Phi\\left( -\\frac{\\mu + S(x) + 2}{\\omega} \\right),\n$$ {#eq-prev-maln}\n\nwhere $\\Phi(\\cdot)$ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution, $\\mu$ is the linear predictor including the effects of covariates at individual- and cluster-level (as defined by the coefficients $\\beta_1$ to $\\beta_3$ of @eq-model-haz-waz) as well as the intercept, and $\\omega^2$ is the variance of the individual-level residual term. In @eq-prev-maln, we condition on $S(x)$ because this allows us to define both stunting an underweight prevalence as a spatially varying predictive target.\n\nTo implement this in `RiskMap`, we begin by generating a predictive grid over the study region. In this case, we use a regular grid with 10 km by 10 km resolution. We then draw predictive samples of the spatial effect $S(x)$ at each grid location, conditional on the observed data.

Cross-validation is conducted by repeatedly splitting the data into training and testing sets, ensuring that prediction locations are at least 5 km away from the nearest training point. Specifically, we set `n_size = 100` prediction locations for the test set, impose a minimum distance constraint of 5 km (`min_dist = 5`), and repeat the process over 10 test sets randomly drawn under those conditions (`iter = 10`) using `method=\"regularized\"` as the sampling method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# HAZ\nassess_haz <-\nassess_pp(list(HAZ = haz_fit),\n          n_size = 100,\n          min_dist = 5,\n          iter = 10,\n          method = \"regularized\")\n\n# WAZ\nassess_waz <-\n  assess_pp(list(WAZ = waz_fit),\n            n_size = 100,\n            min_dist = 5,\n            iter = 10,\n            method = \"regularized\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe note that for a Gaussian linear geostatistical model, the `assess_pp` function does not compute the average non-randomized probability integral transform (AnPIT, introduced in @sec-anpit), as this measure is specifically designed for count outcomes. Instead, it employs the standard probability integral transform (PIT), defined as $\\text{PIT}(y) = F_{M}(y)$, where $F_{M}(y)$ is the cumulative distribution function of the predictive distribution evaluated at the observed value $y$. The PIT transforms the observed outcomes in the test set such that, if the model is well-calibrated, these transformed values should follow a uniform distribution. Deviations from uniformity indicate potential issues with calibration and predictive accuracy.\n\n@fig-maln-pit shows the results of the cross-validation exercise visualized through PIT curves for HAZ and WAZ. Similarly to the way we have interpreted the AnPIT curves, the PIT curves indicate good calibration when they lie close to the identity line, meaning the predictive distributions accurately reflect the observed variability in the test sets. The results shown in @fig-maln-pit demonstrate that, for all ten test sets and for both HAZ and WAZ, the PIT curves closely align with the identity line, confirming that the models are well-calibrated and provide reliable uncertainty quantification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Generate PIT plots\np_haz <- plot_AnPIT(assess_haz, mode = \"all\")\np_waz <- plot_AnPIT(assess_waz, mode = \"all\")\n\n# Arrange side-by-side\nlibrary(gridExtra)\ngrid.arrange(p_haz, p_waz, ncol = 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Assessment of the models calibration.

By modeling these outcomes directly, we were able to define stunting and underweight prevalence as predictive probabilities based on threshold exceedance (e.g., HAZ \\< -2), rather than by dichotomizing the data prior to analysis. This approach allowed us to retain the full information content of the measurements and to produce spatially resolved predictions of prevalence along with associated uncertainty estimates. Readers interested in a more in-depth treatment of this modeling strategy are referred to @kyomuhangi2021, which discusses the loss of information and degradation in predictive performance that can result from dichotomizing continuous outcomes in geostatistical settings.\n\nMore broadly, this case study illustrated how geostatistical models can be used to analyze individual-level outcomes while accounting for both child-level and household-level covariates. Aggregation of data across individuals, such as using average HAZ or WAZ scores per location, is not required and can in fact introduce several complications. In particular, the number of children per cluster varies, which implies that an analysis based on cluster-level averages would require a heteroscedastic specification for the residual term to appropriately reflect varying precision across locations. Ignoring this could lead to unreliable predictive inferences.\n\nIn conclusion, this analysis showed that neither dichotomization nor aggregation is necessary in geostaistical analysis. Instead, geostatistical models should be fitted to individual-level continuous outcomes, and suitable predictive targets and summaries of uncertainty can then be derived from the fitted model.\n\n## Mapping malaria in Malawi\n\nIn this section, we demonstrate how to conduct a geostatistical analysis using Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS) data accessed through the `malariaAtlas` R package [@malariaAtlas]. This package provides streamlined access to a curated repository of georeferenced malaria data, including prevalence surveys and associated metadata, making it a valuable resource for spatial epidemiological studies. The primary aim here is to illustrate how relevant environmental covariates can be obtained via Google Earth Engine and incorporated into a geostatistical model for prevalence mapping. Although the analysis is not guided by a specific research question, its value lies in showcasing the full workflow and technical aspects introduced in previous chapters, including data preparation, covariate extraction, exploratory analysis, model fitting, and spatial prediction of disease prevalence.\n\n### Downloading prevalence and raster data\n\nThis section illustrates how to access and visualize Malaria Indicator Survey data using the `malariaAtlas` R package, focusing on *Plasmodium falciparum* prevalence in Malawi for the year 2006. We walk through the steps to extract survey data, obtain country boundaries, and produce a basic map of raw prevalence data.\n\nWe begin by loading the necessary packages and initializing the Earth Engine API via the `rgee` package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load libraries\nlibrary(malariaAtlas)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(rgee)\nlibrary(terra)\nlibrary(rgeoboundaries)\nlibrary(grid)\n\n# Initialize Earth Engine\nee_Initialize()\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe then use `rgeoboundaries` to obtain Malawi’s administrative boundary and extract P. falciparum prevalence survey data from the `malariaAtlas` package for surveys conducted in or overlapping the year 2006.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Get Malawi boundary\nmlw_admin0_sf <- geoboundaries(country = \"Malawi\", adm_lvl = \"adm0\")\nmlw_admin0_ee <- sf_as_ee(mlw_admin0_sf)\n\n# Download PfPR survey data\nmlw_pfpr <- getPR(country = \"Malawi\", species = \"Pf\") %>%\n  filter(year_start <= 2006 & year_end >= 2006) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(longitude) & !is.na(latitude))\n\n# Convert to sf object\nmlw_sf <- st_as_sf(mlw_pfpr, coords = c(\"longitude\", \"latitude\"), crs = 4326)\n\n# Convert to UTM \nmlw_crs <- propose_utm(mlw_sf)\nmlw_sf <- st_transform(mlw_sf, crs = mlw_crs)\n\n# Remove columns with all NAs\nmlw_sf <- mlw_sf[, colSums(!is.na(mlw_sf)) > 0]\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following map displays the raw prevalence data at each survey location.

All layers are clipped to the Malawi national boundary and combined into a single multi-band image ready for extraction at the survey points.\n\nThese covariates are summarised in Table @tbl-covariates, which also explains their epidemiological relevance in the context of malaria transmission.\n\n| Covariate | Source | Processing | Relevance |\n|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Precipitation | CHIRPS Daily | Annual mean (mm · day⁻¹) | Determines suitability of breeding sites for *Anopheles* mosquitoes. |\n| Land-surface temperature | MODIS MOD11A2 | Kelvin converted to °C; annual mean | Affects mosquito survival and parasite development rates. |\n| NDVI | MODIS MOD13A2 | Scaled to 0–1; annual mean | Proxy for habitat moisture and vegetation cover. |\n| Elevation | SRTM DEM | 90 m; clipped to country boundary | Integrates climatic variation; highlands tend to have lower transmission. |\n| Relative humidity | ERA5-Land | Derived from temperature and dew-point; annual mean (%) | High humidity increases mosquito survival. |\n| Urbanicity (built-up areas) | MODIS MCD12Q1 | Binary indicator (class 13 = urban) | Urban areas generally have lower risk due to infrastructure and fewer breeding sites. |\n\n: Environmental covariates extracted from Google Earth Engine and their relevance for malaria risk modelling. {#tbl-covariates}\n\nWe point out that in order to compute relative humidity, we first extract hourly estimates of air temperature and dew-point temperature at 2 meters above ground level from the ERA5-Land reanalysis product. These two quantities are then combined using a standard empirical formula derived from the Clausius–Clapeyron relation: $$\n\\text{RH} = 100 \\times \\left( \\frac{e^{\\frac{17.625 \\cdot T_d}{243.04 + T_d}}}{e^{\\frac{17.625 \\cdot T}{243.04 + T}}} \\right)\n$$ where $T_d$ is the dew-point temperature and $T$ is the air temperature, both in degrees Celsius. This yields the mean annual relative humidity over the target region, expressed as a percentage.\n\n@tbl-covariates does not provide an exhaustive list of covariates, and other factors such as soil moisture, land surface water, nighttime temperature, or socio-economic indicators like night-time light intensity and land surface emissivity, which may serve as proxies for human activity, infrastructure, or economic development, could also influence malaria risk. However, to maintain this illustrative analysis simpler, we restrict our attention to a core set of covariates that capture key climatic, ecological, and anthropogenic drivers.\n\nIn the code below, all layers are clipped to the boundary of Malawi and combined into a single multi-band image, ready to be extracted at survey point locations for subsequent modeling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# -------------------------------\n# STEP 2: Covariates from Earth Engine\n# -------------------------------\nscale_m <- 1000\n\n# Precipitation\nprecip <- ee$ImageCollection(\"UCSB-CHG/CHIRPS/DAILY\")$\n  filterDate(\"2006-01-01\", \"2006-12-31\")$\n  mean()$rename(\"precip\")$clip(mlw_admin0_ee)$toFloat()\n\n# Temperature\nlst <- ee$ImageCollection(\"MODIS/061/MOD11A2\")$\n  filterDate(\"2006-01-01\", \"2006-12-31\")$\n  select(\"LST_Day_1km\")$mean()$\n  multiply(0.02)$subtract(273.15)$rename(\"lst_c\")$\n  clip(mlw_admin0_ee)$toFloat()\n\n# NDVI\nndvi <- ee$ImageCollection(\"MODIS/061/MOD13A2\")$\n  filterDate(\"2006-01-01\", \"2006-12-31\")$\n  select(\"NDVI\")$mean()$\n  multiply(0.0001)$rename(\"ndvi\")$\n  clip(mlw_admin0_ee)$toFloat()\n\n# Elevation\nelev <- ee$Image(\"USGS/SRTMGL1_003\")$\n  rename(\"elev\")$clip(mlw_admin0_ee)$toFloat()\n\n# Humidity from ERA5 (computed from dewpoint and temperature)\nera5 <- ee$ImageCollection(\"ECMWF/ERA5_LAND/HOURLY\")$\n  filterDate(\"2006-01-01\", \"2006-12-31\")$\n  select(c(\"dewpoint_temperature_2m\", \"temperature_2m\"))$\n  mean()$clip(mlw_admin0_ee)\n\ntd <- era5$select(\"dewpoint_temperature_2m\")$subtract(273.15)\nt <- era5$select(\"temperature_2m\")$subtract(273.15)\n\nrh <- td$expression(\n  \"100 * (exp((17.625 * TD)/(243.04 + TD)) / exp((17.625 * T)/(243.04 + T)))\",\n  list(TD = td, T = t)\n)$rename(\"humidity\")$toFloat()\n\n# Use MODIS Land Cover, version 061\nurban_raw <- ee$ImageCollection(\"MODIS/061/MCD12Q1\")$\n  filterDate(\"2006-01-01\", \"2006-12-31\")$\n  first()$select(\"LC_Type1\")$clip(mlw_admin0_ee)\n\n# Urban areas are class 13 in IGBP classification\nbuilt_up <- urban_raw$eq(13)$rename(\"built_up\")$toFloat()\n\n\n\n# Combine all covariates\ncovariates <- precip$\n  addBands(lst)$\n  addBands(ndvi)$\n  addBands(elev)$\n  addBands(rh)$\n  addBands(built_up)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter defining the multi-band raster image `covariates` in Google Earth Engine, we download it as a GeoTIFF file using the `ee_as_rast()` function from the `rgee` package.

As done previously, to aid interpretation, we fit a LOESS curve (red) to visualise the general trend, and a linear spline (blue) with a change point at 0.75 to capture a simplified parametric relationship. The spline fit suggests a nonlinear association: malaria risk increases with PC1 up to around 0.75, after which it begins to decline. This pattern implies that malaria prevalence is highest in areas with intermediate PC1 values, i.e. environments that are neither too cold and wet nor too hot and arid. In other words, there appears to be an optimal range of environmental conditions, as summarised by PC1, that are most conducive to malaria transmission. Beyond this range, particularly in more heat-arid regions, the risk may decline due to ecological constraints on mosquito survival or parasite development.\n\nIn the next section, we compare two modelling approaches. The first model includes the original environmental covariates using the linear spline specifications identified during our exploratory analysis. The second model replaces these covariates with PC1 alone, treating it as a composite spatial predictor that summarises the dominant environmental gradient in the study area. In both models, we include urbanicity as a separate fixed effect. Urbanicity is excluded from the PCA because it is a binary variable and highly unbalanced, with most survey locations classified as rural. Modelling it separately ensures that its distinct contribution to malaria risk, more linked to infrastructure, housing conditions, and land use, is properly accounted for.\n\n### Model fitting and spatial prediction\n\nIn this section, we fit two geostatistical models to malaria prevalence data from Malawi, comparing the effects of using separate environmental covariates versus summarizing them into a principal component.\n\nThe first model (`mod_all_cov`) includes all environmental covariates as separate predictors. Namely these are precipitation $d_{\\text{prec}}(x)$, NDVI $d_{\\text{ndvi}}(x)$, temperature $d_{\\text{temp}}(x)$, elevation $d_{\\text{elev}}(x)$, humidity $d_{\\text{hum}}(x)$, and urbanicity $d_{\\text{urb}}(x)$. Following from the results of the exploratory analysis, nonlinear effects for temperature, elevation, and humidity are modeled using linear splines with thresholds at 33°C, 400 m, and 65%, respectively. The logit-linear model is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\log\\left\\{\\frac{p(x)}{1 - p(x)}\\right\\} =\\; & \n\\beta_0 + \n\\beta_1 d_{\\text{prec}}(x) +\n\\beta_2 d_{\\text{ndvi}}(x) +\n\\beta_3 d_{\\text{temp}}(x) + \\beta_4 \\max\\{d_{\\text{temp}}(x) - 33,\\; 0\\} \\\\\\\\\n& +\n\\beta_5 d_{\\text{elev}}(x) + \\beta_6 \\max\\{d_{\\text{elev}}(x) - 400,\\; 0\\} \\\\\\\\\n& +\n\\beta_7 d_{\\text{hum}}(x) + \\beta_8 \\max\\{d_{\\text{hum}}(x) - 65,\\; 0\\} \\\\\\\\\n& +\n\\beta_9 d_{\\text{urb}}(x) + S(x)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$.\n\n\nThe second model (`mod_pca`) replaces the continuous covariates with their first principal component $\\text{PC}_1(x)$, allowing for a spline above 0.75. The model becomes:\n\n$$\n\\log\\left\\{\\frac{p(x)}{1-p(x)}\\right\\} = \\beta_0 + \n\\beta_1 \\text{PC}_1(x) + \n\\beta_2 \\max\\{\\text{PC}_1(x) - 0.75,0\\} +\n\\beta_3 d_{\\text{urb}}(x) + S(x)\n$$\n\nThis formulation allows us to assess whether the dimensionality reduction via PCA retains the essential variation in environmental risk while simplifying the model structure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Model with all the covariates as separate predictors\nmod_all_cov <-\nglgpm(positive ~\n    precip +\n    ndvi +\n    lst_c + pmax(lst_c - 33, 0) +\n    elev + pmax(elev - 400, 0) +\n    humidity + pmax(humidity - 65, 0) +\n    built_up + gp(),\n    den = examined,\n    data = mlw_sf,\n    family = \"binomial\")\n\n# Model with all the covariates (except `built_up`)\n# combined into PC1 which is then used as predictor\nmod_pca <-\n  glgpm(positive ~\n          PC1 + pmax(PC1 - 0.75, 0) +\n          built_up + gp(),\n        den = examined,\n        data = mlw_sf,\n        family = \"binomial\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter fitting the two models, when can then compare the summaries of the fits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(mod_all_cov)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nBinomial geostatistical linear model \n'Lower limit' and 'Upper limit' are the limits of the 95% confidence level intervals \n\n Regression coefficients \n                          Estimate Lower limit Upper limit      StdErr  z.value\n(Intercept)            -4.1484e+01 -5.4098e+01 -2.8871e+01  6.4356e+00  -6.4461\nprecip                  3.6000e-01  2.0822e-01  5.1178e-01  7.7441e-02   4.6487\nndvi                    5.1991e+00  4.3228e+00  6.0754e+00  4.4710e-01  11.6285\nlst_c                   9.9929e-02  6.9301e-02  1.3056e-01  1.5626e-02   6.3948\npmax(lst_c - 33, 0)     3.0237e-01  2.5342e-01  3.5132e-01  2.4973e-02  12.1076\nelev                    1.0984e-02  1.0581e-02  1.1386e-02  2.0527e-04  53.5074\npmax(elev - 400, 0)    -1.1358e-02 -1.1732e-02 -1.0984e-02  1.9088e-04 -59.5030\nhumidity                4.7098e-01  4.4719e-01  4.9476e-01  1.2135e-02  38.8129\npmax(humidity - 65, 0) -6.8110e-01 -7.0309e-01 -6.5912e-01  1.1217e-02 -60.7232\nbuilt_up               -6.8574e-01 -7.4216e-01 -6.2931e-01  2.8788e-02 -23.8200\n                         p.value    \n(Intercept)            1.148e-10 ***\nprecip                 3.340e-06 ***\nndvi                   < 2.2e-16 ***\nlst_c                  1.607e-10 ***\npmax(lst_c - 33, 0)    < 2.2e-16 ***\nelev                   < 2.2e-16 ***\npmax(elev - 400, 0)    < 2.2e-16 ***\nhumidity               < 2.2e-16 ***\npmax(humidity - 65, 0) < 2.2e-16 ***\nbuilt_up               < 2.2e-16 ***\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\nOffset included into the linear predictor \n\n Spatial Guassian process \nMatern covariance parameters (kappa=0.5) \n                     Estimate Lower limit Upper limit\nSpatial process var.  0.95284     0.91937      0.9875\nSpatial corr. scale  15.60594    15.02071     16.2140\nVariance of the nugget effect fixed at 0 \n\n Log-likelihood: 13.833\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(mod_pca)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nBinomial geostatistical linear model \n'Lower limit' and 'Upper limit' are the limits of the 95% confidence level intervals \n\n Regression coefficients \n                     Estimate Lower limit Upper limit    StdErr  z.value\n(Intercept)         -0.496575   -0.595285   -0.397866  0.050363  -9.8600\nPC1                  0.258180    0.194448    0.321912  0.032517   7.9399\npmax(PC1 - 0.75, 0) -1.076688   -1.170656   -0.982719  0.047944 -22.4572\nbuilt_up            -0.542019   -0.654257   -0.429781  0.057265  -9.4650\n                      p.value    \n(Intercept)         < 2.2e-16 ***\nPC1                 2.024e-15 ***\npmax(PC1 - 0.75, 0) < 2.2e-16 ***\nbuilt_up            < 2.2e-16 ***\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\nOffset included into the linear predictor \n\n Spatial Guassian process \nMatern covariance parameters (kappa=0.5) \n                     Estimate Lower limit Upper limit\nSpatial process var.   2.0008      1.7939      2.2316\nSpatial corr. scale   30.6995     27.8239     33.8724\nVariance of the nugget effect fixed at 0 \n\n Log-likelihood: 15.90143\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the output above, we see that, compared to the model using all covariates as separate predictors, the model including only PC1 exhibits both a larger estimated spatial correlation scale and higher spatial variance.

We began by downloading geo-referenced survey data from the `malariaAtlas` R package and retrieving relevant environmental covariates from Google Earth Engine. These covariates, selected for their mechanistic relevance to malaria transmission, were processed, clipped to the national boundary, and extracted at survey locations to be used as predictors in subsequent modelling.\n\nA critical step in the analysis involved the exploration of relationships between environmental conditions and malaria prevalence. Through scatterplots and spline fits, we identified key nonlinearities in variables such as temperature, elevation, and humidity, which informed the functional form of covariate effects in the regression model. This exploratory work is essential not only for model formulation but also for understanding the ecological underpinnings of disease risk.\n\nTo address potential collinearity and reduce the complexity of the model, we also illustrated the use of PCA as a method for dimensionality reduction. The first principal component (PC1) captured a dominant environmental gradient, summarizing variation across temperature, humidity, elevation, and vegetation, which was then used as a composite predictor in a reduced model. A simpler alternative is to let the data guide you through stepwise selection based on p-values—for example, adding or removing covariates until all retained terms meet a preset significance threshold. When the pool of candidate predictors is large relative to the sample size, however, stepwise methods can become unstable and over-fit; in such cases penalised approaches (e.g. ridge, lasso) or resampling-based strategies are usually preferred. A thorough discussion of these issues, with practical recommendations, is given in Section 4.7 of @harrell2015.\n\nWe compared two geostatistical models: one using all environmental covariates as separate predictors (with spline terms for nonlinear effects), and another using PC1 as a summary predictor. Cross-validation based on geographically stratified folds revealed that the full model was better calibrated and achieved sharper predictions, as measured by lower CRPS and AnPIT curves closer to the identity line.\n\nWe encourage the reader to explore Exercise 2 at the end of this chapter, where you will investigate whether including a second principal component (PC2) alongside PC1 leads to improved predictive performance. This offers an opportunity to assess whether PCA-based dimensionality reduction can match or exceed the predictive accuracy of models that include all covariates, while potentially offering greater parsimony.\n\n## Mapping the entomological incoluation rate for West Nile Virus in the Sacramento Metropolitan Area, United States\n\nIn this section, we use entomological surveillance data from the `vectorsurvR` R package, which provides detailed records of mosquito collections, species identification, trapping effort, and pathogen testing across multiple locations in the United States. The dataset includes mosquito pool-level information such as counts, species, trap dates and locations, and test results for several arboviruses.\n\nThis analysis focuses on the mosquito species *Culex pipiens* in areas across the Sacramento Metropolitan Area (SMA), California, over the period 2015 to 2021. *Cx. pipiens* is one of the primary vector species responsible for the transmission of West Nile Virus (WNV) in North America. This time-aggregated subset allows us to investigate spatial patterns of mosquito abundance and WNV presence over several years of surveillance.\n\nWest Nile Virus is an arbovirus maintained in an enzootic transmission cycle between *Culex* mosquitoes and birds, with humans and other mammals acting as incidental, dead-end hosts. Human infections can range from asymptomatic to severe neurological disease. Surveillance of both vector abundance and WNV positivity is therefore critical for anticipating human risk and targeting public health interventions. In particular, understanding spatial variation in entomological indicators—such as the expected number of infected mosquitoes—can help identify areas of elevated transmission potential and guide vector control strategies.\n\n### Exploratory analysis\n\nWe begin by loading the necessary libraries and the data provided by the `vectorsurvR` package. The main dataset, `sample_pools`, contains information on mosquito pool species, collection date, location, and pathogen testing results. Additional trap-level metadata, including trapping effort, is provided in the `sample_collections` dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrm(list = ls())\n\nlibrary(vectorsurvR)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tigris)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\noptions(tigris_use_cache = TRUE)\n\ndata(sample_pools)\ndata(sample_collections)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe restrict the data to mosquito pools identified as Cx pipiens and tested for WNV, across all years available in the dataset, from 2015 to 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nspecies_name <- \"Cx pipiens\"\n\nmerged <- sample_pools %>%\n  filter(species_display_name == species_name,\n         test_target_acronym == \"WNV\") %>%\n  left_join(sample_collections %>% select(collection_id, trap_nights),\n            by = c(\"id\" = \"collection_id\", \"surv_year\"))\n\nlibrary(rgeoboundaries)\nca_counties <- geoboundaries(\"United States of America\", adm_lvl = \"ADM2\")\nsma_names <- c(\"Sacramento\", \"Placer\", \"El Dorado\")\nsma_boundaries <- ca_counties[ca_counties$shapeName %in% sma_names, ]\n\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe then group the filtered data by trap location, computing the year of the survey, the total number of mosquitoes captured, the number of pools tested for WNV, and the number of pools that tested positive.

Changes in environmental conditions, climate, or vector control efforts may lead to substantial year-to-year fluctuations in mosquito populations. Additionally, if different geographic areas were sampled in different years, this could introduce spatial confounding, making it difficult to disentangle spatial from temporal effects.\n\nThe top panel of @fig-wnv-years reveals that while some spatial variation in sampling locations is present across years, there remains sufficient geographic overlap to enable estimation of temporal trends in mosquito counts. The bottom panel shows a clear temporal pattern: mosquito abundance was highest in 2015, remained relatively stable from 2016 to 2018, and then declined noticeably from 2019 to 2021. The observed decline in Cx. pipiens abundance from 2019 to 2021 likely reflects two key drivers: reduced availability of aquatic breeding sites due to drought, and intensified vector control efforts. @bhattachan2023drought showed that *Cx. pipiens* populations in southern California dropped by about $40\\%$ during the 2012–2016 drought, linked to water-use restrictions that limited larval habitat in storm drains and catch basins. At the same time, vector control districts expanded targeted interventions. For example, the Sacramento–Yolo district treated over 160,000 drains in 2018 alone [@sacramento2018annual], and the statewide response plan formalised such practices as part of integrated mosquito management [@cdph2025response].  This temporal feature of the data will thus need to be acknowledged in the next stage of the analysis of the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n\n# Panel 1: Faceted trap locations by year (larger points and titles)\np_locs <- ggplot(wnv_summary) +\n  geom_sf(data = sma_boundaries, fill = NA, color = \"black\", size = 0.3) +\n  geom_sf(color = \"black\", alpha = 0.8, size = 0.8) +\n  facet_wrap(~year, ncol = 4) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Trap locations by year\") +\n  theme(\n    strip.text = element_text(size = 13, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5),\n    axis.text = element_blank(),\n    axis.ticks = element_blank()\n  )\n\n# Summary for bar plot\nannual_summary <- wnv_summary %>%\n  group_by(year) %>%\n  summarise(\n    total_mosquitoes = sum(total_mosquitoes, na.rm = TRUE),\n    total_traps = n(),  # each row in wnv_summary corresponds to a trap location\n    mosq_per_trap = total_mosquitoes / total_traps,\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  )\n\n# Panel 2: Average mosquitoes per trap event by year\np_pertrap <- ggplot(annual_summary, aes(x = factor(year), y = mosq_per_trap)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"steelblue\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Average mosquitoes per trap\", x = \"Year\", y = \"Mosquitoes per trap\") +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 11)\n  )\n\n# Combine panels: faceted maps on top, bar chart on bottom\n(p_locs / p_pertrap) +\n  plot_layout(heights = c(3, 1)) +\n  plot_annotation(\n    theme = theme(\n      plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5)\n    )\n  )\n\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Spatial and temporal overview of *Cx. pipiens* surveillance in the Sacramento Metropolitan Area from 2015 to 2021.

This lack of evidence may be due to the fact that mosquito abundance is influenced by very local environmental conditions such as vegetation, drainage, or breeding site availability, which vary at spatial scales smaller than 1 km. Since only a few trap locations in the dataset are spaced closely enough to capture such fine-scale variation, the analysis may lack the resolution needed to detect spatial dependence. Therefore, although a geostatistical model is not justified in this case, we can still pursue our objective of estimating the average number of mosquitoes at the sampled locations.\n\n\n## Exercises\n\n1.

What is the interpretation of PC2? What kind of relationship does PC2 show with the empirical logit?\n\n    - Fit a geostatistical model that includes both PC1 and PC2 as covariates. How do the covariance parameters of the spatial process change after including PC2 compared to the model with PC1 only?\n\n    - Compare this model to:\n        - the model using only PC1, and\n        - the model using all covariates as separate predictors.  \n      \n      Use the AnPIT plot and CRPS/SCRPS scores to assess predictive performance.\n\n    - Discuss whether adding PC2 captures additional meaningful variation or introduces multicollinearity or overfitting. What implications does this have for model interpretability and parsimony?\n\n\n3. In this exercise, you will repeat the full analysis pipeline developed for Malawi using data from a different country.\n\n    - Choose a different country available in the `malariaAtlas` package (e.g., Zambia or Nigeria), and download parasite prevalence survey data for a specific year.\n\n    - Obtain the same set of environmental covariates used in the Malawi analysis, and prepare them for analysis (e.g., resample, standardize, and extract values at survey locations).\n\n    - Fit and compare two geostatistical models:\n        - A model using the environmental covariates as separate fixed effects.\n        - A model using the first principal component (PC1) as a synthetic covariate summarizing the covariate space.\n\n    - Evaluate model performance using the AnPIT plot and CRPS/SCRPS scores.\n\n    - Reflect on which model performs better in this new setting.
