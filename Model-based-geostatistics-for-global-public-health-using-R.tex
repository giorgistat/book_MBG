Its companion book ``Model-based geostatistical for global public
health'\,' by Diggle (2019) is a strongly recommended complementary
read, as you work your way through this book.

\bookmarksetup{startatroot}

\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\chapter{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

The book provides shows how to carry out model-based geostatistical
analysis of public health data using the \texttt{RiskMap} R package. In
this introductory chapter, we explain what are the pre-requisites for
using this book and its learning objectives. We also explain what
software should be installed and how. Finally, we give a brief overview
of the class of models covered in this book, and the examples that will
be used to illustrate the methods and use of software.

\hypertarget{objectives-of-this-book}{%
\section{Objectives of this book}\label{objectives-of-this-book}}

The overall aim of this book is to provide you with the skills to
perform a geostatistical analysis of a data-set using the R software
environment. As you work your way through the book, you will learn to:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  explore geostatistical data-sets using graphical procedures and
  summary statistics;
\item
  formulate and fit geostatistical models using the maximum likelihood
  estimation method;
\item
  carry out prediction of health outcomes at different spatial scales;
\item
  visualize and interpret the results from geostatistical models;
\item
  model the relationships between spatially referenced risk factors and
  the health outcome of interest;
\item
  validate the assumptions of geostatistical models and assess their
  predictive performance.
\end{itemize}

Although the focus of this book is on public health, the statistical
ideas, as well as the software used, can also be applied for the
analysis of geostatistical data-sets arising from other scientific
fields.

\hypertarget{pre-requisites-for-using-this-book}{%
\section{Pre-requisites for using this
book}\label{pre-requisites-for-using-this-book}}

To effectively understand and use the material presented in this book,
it is expected that you should possess prior knowledge of basic
probability theory, foundational topics in statistical modelling and R
programming. Below we provide a more detailed explanation of the
pre-requisites for each of these three fields.

\hypertarget{topics-in-probability}{%
\subsection{Topics in probability}\label{topics-in-probability}}

Basics probability theory is important to fully understand the content
of this book. In particular, you should have knowledge of: the general
definition and properties of continuous and discrete distribution; how
the describe the properties of probability distributions through their
mean, variance and skeweness; the concepts of stochastic dependence and
correaltion; the distinction between marginal and conditional
distributions; the basic properties of the Gaussian, Binomial and
Poisson distributions; the definition and properties of the multivariate
Gaussian distribution. The redear can find an extensive explanation and
illustrations with examples of all these topics in Ross (2013).

\hypertarget{topics-in-statistics}{%
\subsection{Topics in statistics}\label{topics-in-statistics}}

Likelihood-based inference (whether frequensist or Bayesian) provides
the theoretical bedrock for the estimation of almost any statistical
model. In this book will focus on maximum likelihood estimation methods
of inference. Extensive use of the notions of point and interval
estimates obtained using the maximum likelihood estimation methods will
be made through the book. Recommended readings include chapters 1, 2 and
4 of Pawitan (2001).

Good knowledge of Generalized linear models (GLMs) is essential, as the
geostatistical modelling framework builds on these as an extension.
Before embarking on the use of this book, we thus encourage you to
review the basic theory of GLMs and, in particular, how these are
applied and interpreted. In this book, we will cover examples that will
model continuously measured outcomes and counts. Hence, good
understanding of linear regression modelling and modelling of counts
data using Binomial and Poisson regression should be the main focus of
the review. For comprehensive overview of GLMs and their implementation
in R, we refer you to Dobson and Barnett (2008).

\hypertarget{topics-in-r-programming}{%
\subsection{Topics in R programming}\label{topics-in-r-programming}}

Although this book does not require to possess advanced skills in R
programming, it is important you have good knowledge in the following
topics: creation and manipulation of vectors and matrices; logical
vectors; character vectors; handling of lists and data frame objects;
reading data into R; graphical procedures. A very large amount of freely
available material covering these topics can be found online. Our
recommendation is to start from the manual ``An introduction to R'' of
the Comprehensive R Archive Network available at this link, available at
\href{https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html}{R manual}.

\hypertarget{obtaining-and-running-the-r-packages}{%
\section{Obtaining and running the R
packages}\label{obtaining-and-running-the-r-packages}}

It is advised that you obtain the latest 64-bit version of R in order to
run the R code of this book. To install R, go to the R website, where
you can download the installer packages for Windows and Mac, and find
instructions for Linux, using binary files.

\hypertarget{example-data-sets-used-in-the-book}{%
\section{Example data-sets used in the
book}\label{example-data-sets-used-in-the-book}}

The geostatistical data-sets described in this section will be used
throughout the book to illustrate the use of the R packages mentioned in
the previous sections.

Each of the three data-sets can be loaded from the \texttt{RiskMap}
package, using the command

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{data}\NormalTok{(galicia)}
\end{Highlighting}

for the river-blindness data-set, and

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{data}\NormalTok{(anopheles)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

for the Anhopheles mosquitoes data-set.

In the final chapter of this book, we will consider the analysis of
additional data-sets to review the main statistical concepts presented
in this book.

\hypertarget{lead-concentration-in-galicia}{%
\subsection{Lead concentration in
Galicia}\label{lead-concentration-in-galicia}}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{./figures/galicia_ch1.png}

}

\caption{Figure 1.1: Data on the meausred lead concentration (in
micrograms per gram dry weight) in moss samples collected in Galicia,
North-West of Spain.}

\end{figure}

Lead is a heavy metal which, in high concentrations, can cause chronic
damage to living organisms over a long period of time. For this reason
its spread and source must be regularly monitored. To assess the extent
of the contamination in an area, measurements of lead are often taken
from plants. The data here considered (Figure 1.1) consist of 132
locations of moss samples collected in 2000, in and around Galicia, a
region in the North-Western part of Spain. One of the objectives of this
survey was to establish the spatial pattern of lead concentration in
Galicia so as to better identify possible sources of contamination; fore
more information, see Fernández, Rey, and Carballeira (2000).

In this case, geostatistical modelling can be used to predict the lead
concentration across Galicia and allows to disentangle variation which
is purely random, possibly due to measurement error, and genuine spatial
variation, which is our main object of interest.

This data-set will be used in this book to show how to carry out the
spatial analysis of continuously measured variables using linear
geostatistical models.

\hypertarget{river-blindness-in-liberia}{%
\subsection{River-blindness in
Liberia}\label{river-blindness-in-liberia}}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{./figures/liberia_ch1.png}

}

\caption{Figure 1.2: River-blindness data from a cross-sectional survey
carried out in Liberia}

\end{figure}

In low-resource settings, where disease registries are typically absent,
cross-sectional surveys are an essential monitoring tool that enables
the estimation of the disease burden in a population of interest. The
data considered in this example have been collected as part of an
Africa-wide initiative called the Rapid Epidemiological Mapping of
Onchocerchiasis (REMO) carried out in 2011 in 20 African countries
(Zouré et al. (2014)). The goal of REMO is to identify areas where
river-blindness (or onchocerchiasis), a disease transmitted by black
flies who breed along fast flowing rivers, is still a public health
problem. In this context, it is especially of interest to identify
communities with a prevalence above 20\% and for treatment is urgently
needed.

In this book, we will use data collected from Liberia to model nodule
prevalence, which is based on a alternative and cheaper diagnostic
technique for river-blindness. In the analysis of this data-set, we will
illustrate how to formulate and fit Binomial geostatistical models, and
how these can be used to predict prevalence within a region of interest.

\caption{Figure 1.3: Map of the collected number of \emph{Anopheles

\end{figure}

In studies of vector-borne and zoonotic diseases, understanding of the
vector distribution can help to better guide the decision-making process
for the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of control programmes.
\emph{Anopheles gambiae} mosquitoes are one of the main vectors for
malaria transmission in sub-Saharan Africa. Their distribution over
space is affected by several environmental and climatic factors,
including temperature, humidity and vegetation.

The data-set considered in this example is a sub-set taken from a large
database (Tene Fossog et al. (2015)) that was assembled to understand
how the environment affects the distribution of different species of
\emph{Anopheles} mosquitoes in sub-Saharan Africa. We will use this
data-set as an example in this book to illustrate application of Poisson
geostatistical models for mapping mosquitoes abundance.

\section{Geostatistical problems and geostatistical
models}\label{geostatistical-problems-and-geostatistical-models}}

The main characteristic shared by the examples described in the previous
section is that, in each of those, the goal of statistical analysis is
to draw inferences on an unobserved spatially continuous surface using
data collected from a finite set of locations.
